If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},"@jest/console@24.9.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/facebook/jest","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/jest/raw/master/LICENSE","parents":"eoc-app","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/@jest/console","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/@jest/console/LICENSE","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS (v4a) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent\n"},"airbnb-prop-types@2.15.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/airbnb/prop-types","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/airbnb/prop-types/raw/master/LICENSE","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Jordan Harband","email":"ljharb@gmail.com","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/airbnb-prop-types","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/airbnb-prop-types/LICENSE","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Airbnb\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Like\n`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n```javascript\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n        assert.object(options, 'options');\n        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');\n        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n        assert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n        callback(null, {});\n    }\n```\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n```javascript\n    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');\n```\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are\nalso disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from\nthe `assert` module avoids this behavior.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.array\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.finite\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.stream\n* assert.date\n* assert.regexp\n* assert.uuid\n* assert.arrayOfArray\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfBuffer\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfFinite\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.arrayOfStream\n* assert.arrayOfDate\n* assert.arrayOfRegexp\n* assert.arrayOfUuid\n* assert.optionalArray\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalFinite\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalStream\n* assert.optionalDate\n* assert.optionalRegexp\n* assert.optionalUuid\n* assert.optionalArrayOfArray\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFinite\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfStream\n* assert.optionalArrayOfDate\n* assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp\n* assert.optionalArrayOfUuid\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Based off of [benjamn/ast-types](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types).\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst install `ast-types-flow` via npm, then you can import any of the types\nthat are exported.\n\n```javascript\n/* @flow */\n\nimport type {Node} from 'ast-types-flow';\n\nfunction getName(node: Node): string {\n  switch (node.type) {\n    case 'Identifier':\n      return node.name;\n\n    case 'ClassDeclaration':\n      return node.id.name; // Error, id could be null.\n\n    case 'FunctionDeclaration':\n      return node.id.name; // Fine if it's always there.\n\n    case 'FunctionExpression':\n      if (node.id) {\n        return node.id.name; // Can refine id to make sure it exists.\n      } else {\n        return 'Unknown';\n      }\n\n    case 'Literal':\n      return node.name; // Error, Literals don't have names, don't be silly.\n  }\n  return 'Unknown';\n}\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nA notion of \"extends\" is added to the Flow syntax via comments. A transform is\nincluded that will compile the source code into useful disjoint union types\nbased on how the different types extend each other. For example:\n\n```javascript\ntype Node = {\n  common: string,\n};\n\ntype Foo = {\n  // extends Node\n  foo: string,\n};\n\ntype Bar = {\n  // extends Node\n  bar: number,\n};\n```\n\nWill be transformed into:\n\n```javascript\ntype Node = {\n  type: 'Foo',\n  _Foo: void,\n  common: string,\n  foo: string,\n} | {\n  type: 'Bar',\n  _Bar: void,\n  common: string,\n  bar: number,\n};\n\ntype Foo = {\n  type: 'Foo',\n  _Foo: void,\n  common: string,\n  foo: string,\n};\n\ntype Bar = {\n  type: 'Bar',\n  _Foo: void,\n  common: string,\n  bar: number,\n};\n```\n\nA few things to note:\n\n1. The type `Node` would more ideally be compiled into `Foo | Bar` but then the\ndisjoint union cannot be properly refined. For now we have to duplicate the\ncomplete definitions.\n2. Each entry in a disjoint union has to be structurally unique or Flow will\nhave an error on the definition. That is why the private `_Foo: void` fields\nappear in the types.\n"},"astral-regex@1.0.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/kevva/astral-regex","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/kevva/astral-regex/raw/master/license","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Kevin Mårtensson","email":"kevinmartensson@gmail.com","url":"github.com/kevva","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/astral-regex","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/astral-regex/license","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) Kevin Mårtensson <kevinmartensson@gmail.com> (github.com/kevva)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Here\nis the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:\n\n* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on\n  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs\n* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or\n  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations\n  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be\n  added to the result to make it positive\n\n### Postfixes\n\nThe only available postfix at the moment is:\n\n* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript\n  Number. Decimals are not supported.\n\n### Examples\n\n* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`\n* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value\n* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13\n\n## Instructions\n\nPrefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be\neither `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).\n\n### Utilities\n\n* `a.clone()` - clone number\n* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes\n* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)\n* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)\n* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero\n  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding\n* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,\n  which must behave like an `Array`\n* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For\n  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:\n  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`\n* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied\n* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits\n  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)\n* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied\n* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative\n* `a.isEven()` - no comments\n* `a.isOdd()` - no comments\n* `a.isZero()` - no comments\n* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)\n  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)\n* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width\n* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width\n* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance\n\n### Arithmetics\n\n* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)\n* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)\n* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)\n* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`\n* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)\n* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)\n* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division\n\n### Bit operations\n\n* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced\n  with `andn` in future)\n* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`\n* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set\n* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)\n* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number\n* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)\n\n### Reduction\n\n* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD\n* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)\n* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`\n\n## Fast reduction\n\nWhen doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to\nuse some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm\nfor [Mersenne Prime][1].\n\n### Reduction context\n\nTo enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(num);\n```\nwhere `num` is just a BN instance.\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(primeName);\n```\n\nWhere `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:\n\n* `'k256'`\n* `'p224'`\n* `'p192'`\n* `'p25519'`\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.mont(num);\n```\n\nTo reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than\n`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.\n\n### Converting numbers\n\nBefore performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted\nto it. Usually, this means that one should:\n\n* Convert inputs to reducted ones\n* Operate on them in reduction context\n* Convert outputs back from the reduction context\n\nHere is how one may convert numbers to `red`:\n\n```js\nvar redA = a.toRed(red);\n```\nWhere `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above\n\nHere is how to convert them back:\n\n```js\nvar a = redA.fromRed();\n```\n\n### Red instructions\n\nMost of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their\ncounterparts in red context:\n\n* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`\n* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`\n* `a.redShl(num)`\n* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`\n* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`\n* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime\n* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number\n* `a.redNeg()`\n* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions.

Throws an error if the\ninput is invalid.\n\n```js\nvar obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);\n```\n\n### bser.dumpToBuffer\n\nSynchronously encodes a value as BSER.\n\n```js\nvar encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);\nconsole.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']\n```\n\n### BunserBuf\n\nThe asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.\nYou may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the\ndecoded values via its `value` event.\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log(obj);\n});\n```\n\nThen in your socket `data` event:\n\n```js\nbunser.append(buf);\n```\n\n## Example\n\nRead BSER from socket:\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log('data from socket', obj);\n});\n\nvar socket = net.connect('/socket');\n\nsocket.on('data', function(buf) {\n  bunser.append(buf);\n});\n```\n\nWrite BSER to socket:\n\n```js\nsocket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));\n```\n"},"bson@1.1.1":{"licenses":"Apache-2.0","repository":"https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/raw/master/LICENSE.md","parents":"agenda:eoc-app","publisher":"Christian Amor Kvalheim","email":"christkv@gmail.com","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/agenda/node_modules/bson","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/agenda/node_modules/bson/LICENSE.md","licenseText":"                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected.

If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j.

Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Although there are other ones, they either do too much or not enough.\n\n**Chalk is a clean and focused alternative.**\n\n![screenshot](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-styles/raw/master/screenshot.png)\n\n\n## Why\n\n- Highly performant\n- Doesn't extend String.prototype\n- Expressive API\n- Ability to nest styles\n- Clean and focused\n- Auto-detects color support\n- Actively maintained\n- [Used by 1000+ modules](https://npmjs.org/browse/depended/chalk)\n\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save chalk\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nChalk comes with an easy to use composable API where you just chain and nest the styles you want.\n\n```js\nvar chalk = require('chalk');\n\n// style a string\nconsole.log(  chalk.blue('Hello world!')  );\n\n// combine styled and normal strings\nconsole.log(  chalk.blue('Hello'), 'World' + chalk.red('!')  );\n\n// compose multiple styles using the chainable API\nconsole.log(  chalk.blue.bgRed.bold('Hello world!')  );\n\n// pass in multiple arguments\nconsole.log(  chalk.blue('Hello', 'World!', 'Foo', 'bar', 'biz', 'baz')  );\n\n// nest styles\nconsole.log(  chalk.red('Hello', chalk.underline.bgBlue('world') + '!')  );\n\n// nest styles of the same type even (color, underline, background)\nconsole.log(  chalk.green('I am a green line ' + chalk.blue('with a blue substring') + ' that becomes green again!')  );\n```\n\nEasily define your own themes.\n\n```js\nvar chalk = require('chalk');\nvar error = chalk.bold.red;\nconsole.log(error('Error!'));\n```\n\nTake advantage of console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data).\n\n```js\nvar name = 'Sindre';\nconsole.log(chalk.green('Hello %s'), name);\n//=> Hello Sindre\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### chalk.`<style>[.<style>...](string, [string...])`\n\nExample: `chalk.red.bold.underline('Hello', 'world');`\n\nChain [styles](#styles) and call the last one as a method with a string argument. Order doesn't matter.\n\nMultiple arguments will be separated by space.\n\n### chalk.enabled\n\nColor support is automatically detected, but you can override it.\n\n### chalk.supportsColor\n\nDetect whether the terminal [supports color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/supports-color).\n\nCan be overridden by the user with the flags `--color` and `--no-color`.\n\nUsed internally and handled for you, but exposed for convenience.\n\n### chalk.styles\n\nExposes the styles as [ANSI escape codes](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-styles).\n\nGenerally not useful, but you might need just the `.open` or `.close` escape code if you're mixing externally styled strings with yours.\n\n```js\nvar chalk = require('chalk');\n\nconsole.log(chalk.styles.red);\n//=> {open: '\\u001b[31m', close: '\\u001b[39m'}\n\nconsole.log(chalk.styles.red.open + 'Hello' + chalk.styles.red.close);\n```\n\n### chalk.hasColor(string)\n\nCheck whether a string [has color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/has-ansi).\n\n### chalk.stripColor(string)\n\n[Strip color](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-ansi) from a string.\n\nCan be useful in combination with `.supportsColor` to strip color on externally styled text when it's not supported.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nvar chalk = require('chalk');\nvar styledString = getText();\n\nif (!chalk.supportsColor) {\n\tstyledString = chalk.stripColor(styledString);\n}\n```\n\n\n## Styles\n\n### General\n\n- `reset`\n- `bold`\n- `dim`\n- `italic` *(not widely supported)*\n- `underline`\n- `inverse`\n- `hidden`\n- `strikethrough` *(not widely supported)*\n\n### Text colors\n\n- `black`\n- `red`\n- `green`\n- `yellow`\n- `blue`\n- `magenta`\n- `cyan`\n- `white`\n- `gray`\n\n### Background colors\n\n- `bgBlack`\n- `bgRed`\n- `bgGreen`\n- `bgYellow`\n- `bgBlue`\n- `bgMagenta`\n- `bgCyan`\n- `bgWhite`\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Sindre Sorhus](http://sindresorhus.com)\n"},"chalk@1.1.3":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/chalk/chalk","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/chalk/chalk/raw/master/license","parents":"listr-update-renderer:eoc-app","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/listr-update-renderer/node_modules/chalk","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/listr-update-renderer/node_modules/chalk/license","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) Sindre Sorhus <sindresorhus@gmail.com> (sindresorhus.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with\nimplementations like `kqueue` available on most \\*nix platforms. Chokidar still\ndoes have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.\n\nOn other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which\navoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate\nwatchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been\nspecified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much\nmore than needed.\n\n## Getting started\nInstall with npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install chokidar\n```\n\nThen `require` and use it in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar chokidar = require('chokidar');\n\n// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles\nchokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {\n  console.log(event, path);\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a more typical implementation structure:\n\n// Initialize watcher.\nvar watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {\n  ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../,\n  persistent: true\n});\n\n// Something to use when events are received.\nvar log = console.log.bind(console);\n// Add event listeners.\nwatcher\n  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))\n  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));\n\n// More possible events.\nwatcher\n  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))\n  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))\n  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))\n  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {\n    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);\n  });\n\n// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second\n// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats\nwatcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {\n  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);\n});\n\n// Watch new files.\nwatcher.add('new-file');\nwatcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);\n\n// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem\nvar watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();\n\n// Un-watch some files.\nwatcher.unwatch('new-file*');\n\n// Stop watching.\nwatcher.close();\n\n// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)\nchokidar.watch('file', {\n  persistent: true,\n\n  ignored: '*.txt',\n  ignoreInitial: false,\n  followSymlinks: true,\n  cwd: '.',\n  disableGlobbing: false,\n\n  usePolling: true,\n  interval: 100,\n  binaryInterval: 300,\n  alwaysStat: false,\n  depth: 99,\n  awaitWriteFinish: {\n    stabilityThreshold: 2000,\n    pollInterval: 100\n  },\n\n  ignorePermissionErrors: false,\n  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)\n});\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`\n\n* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched\nrecursively, or glob patterns.\n* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:\n\n#### Persistence\n\n* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process\nshould continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to\n`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted\nafter `ready`, even if the process continues to run.\n\n#### Path filtering\n\n* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\nDefines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is\ntested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it\ngets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second\ntime with two arguments (the path and the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject of that path).\n* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while\ninstantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).\n* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the\nsymlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following\nthe link references and bubbling events through the link's path.\n* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be\nderived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.\n* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as\nliteral path names, even if they look like globs.\n\n#### Performance\n\n* `usePolling` (default: `false`).\nWhether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling\nleads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is\ntypically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over\na network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other\nnon-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the\n`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable\nto true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.\n* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)\n  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also\n    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.\n  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system\n  polling for binary files.\n  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))\n* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the\n`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly\nand `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When\nset to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.\n* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set\nthis to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't\nalready available from the underlying watch events.\n* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of\nsubdirectories will be traversed.\n* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).\nBy default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before\nthe entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`\nevents will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,\nespecially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the\nwrite operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.\nSetting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,\nholding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a\nconfigurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily\ndependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should\nbe relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.\nUse with caution.\n  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust\n  timing params:*\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in\n  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.\n\n#### Errors\n* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files\nthat don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`\nor `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.\n* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).\nAutomatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use\n\"atomic writes\" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is\nre-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event\nrather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well\nfor you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in\nmilliseconds.\n\n### Methods & Events\n\n`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:\n\n* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.\nAvailable events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,\n`raw`, `error`.\nAdditionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event\nname and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.\n* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.\n* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file\nsystem being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the\ndirectories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the\nvalues are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out\n[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to\nexecute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.\n\n## Install Troubleshooting\n\n* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`\n  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is\n    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,\n    Chokidar should function properly.\n\n* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable \"python\" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`\n  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:\n    `npm config set python python2.7`\n\n* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`\n  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

They require a `head` setting when instantiated that has an empty string as the first header\n2. The individual rows take the general form of { \"Header\": [\"Row\", \"Values\"] }\n\n```javascript\nvar Table = require('cli-table');\nvar table = new Table({ head: [\"\", \"Top Header 1\", \"Top Header 2\"] });\n\ntable.push(\n    { 'Left Header 1': ['Value Row 1 Col 1', 'Value Row 1 Col 2'] }\n  , { 'Left Header 2': ['Value Row 2 Col 1', 'Value Row 2 Col 2'] }\n);\n\nconsole.log(table.toString());\n```\n\n### Custom styles\nThe ```chars``` property controls how the table is drawn:\n```javascript\nvar table = new Table({\n  chars: { 'top': '═' , 'top-mid': '╤' , 'top-left': '╔' , 'top-right': '╗'\n         , 'bottom': '═' , 'bottom-mid': '╧' , 'bottom-left': '╚' , 'bottom-right': '╝'\n         , 'left': '║' , 'left-mid': '╟' , 'mid': '─' , 'mid-mid': '┼'\n         , 'right': '║' , 'right-mid': '╢' , 'middle': '│' }\n});\n\ntable.push(\n    ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']\n  , ['frob', 'bar', 'quuz']\n);\n\nconsole.log(table.toString());\n// Outputs:\n//\n//╔══════╤═════╤══════╗\n//║ foo  │ bar │ baz  ║\n//╟──────┼─────┼──────╢\n//║ frob │ bar │ quuz ║\n//╚══════╧═════╧══════╝\n```\n\nEmpty decoration lines will be skipped, to avoid vertical separator rows just\nset the 'mid', 'left-mid', 'mid-mid', 'right-mid' to the empty string:\n```javascript\nvar table = new Table({ chars: {'mid': '', 'left-mid': '', 'mid-mid': '', 'right-mid': ''} });\ntable.push(\n    ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']\n  , ['frobnicate', 'bar', 'quuz']\n);\n\nconsole.log(table.toString());\n// Outputs: (note the lack of the horizontal line between rows)\n//┌────────────┬─────┬──────┐\n//│ foo        │ bar │ baz  │\n//│ frobnicate │ bar │ quuz │\n//└────────────┴─────┴──────┘\n```\n\nBy setting all chars to empty with the exception of 'middle' being set to a\nsingle space and by setting padding to zero, it's possible to get the most\ncompact layout with no decorations:\n```javascript\nvar table = new Table({\n  chars: { 'top': '' , 'top-mid': '' , 'top-left': '' , 'top-right': ''\n         , 'bottom': '' , 'bottom-mid': '' , 'bottom-left': '' , 'bottom-right': ''\n         , 'left': '' , 'left-mid': '' , 'mid': '' , 'mid-mid': ''\n         , 'right': '' , 'right-mid': '' , 'middle': ' ' },\n  style: { 'padding-left': 0, 'padding-right': 0 }\n});\n\ntable.push(\n    ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']\n  , ['frobnicate', 'bar', 'quuz']\n);\n\nconsole.log(table.toString());\n// Outputs:\n//foo        bar baz\n//frobnicate bar quuz\n```\n\n## Running tests\n\nClone the repository with all its submodules and run:\n\n```bash\n$ make test\n```\n\n## Credits\n\n- Guillermo Rauch &lt;guillermo@learnboost.com&gt;

Some people seem to be afraid of extending `String.prototype` and prefer the second way. \n\nIf you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch `String.prototype`, the second usage will not touch `String` native object.\n\n## Disabling Colors\n\nTo disable colors you can pass the following arguments in the command line to your application:\n\n```bash\nnode myapp.js --no-color\n```\n\n## Console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data)\n\n```js\nvar name = 'Marak';\nconsole.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name);\n// outputs -> 'Hello Marak'\n```\n\n## Custom themes\n\n### Using standard API\n\n```js\n\nvar colors = require('colors');\n\ncolors.setTheme({\n  silly: 'rainbow',\n  input: 'grey',\n  verbose: 'cyan',\n  prompt: 'grey',\n  info: 'green',\n  data: 'grey',\n  help: 'cyan',\n  warn: 'yellow',\n  debug: 'blue',\n  error: 'red'\n});\n\n// outputs red text\nconsole.log(\"this is an error\".error);\n\n// outputs yellow text\nconsole.log(\"this is a warning\".warn);\n```\n\n### Using string safe API\n\n```js\nvar colors = require('colors/safe');\n\n// set single property\nvar error = colors.red;\nerror('this is red');\n\n// set theme\ncolors.setTheme({\n  silly: 'rainbow',\n  input: 'grey',\n  verbose: 'cyan',\n  prompt: 'grey',\n  info: 'green',\n  data: 'grey',\n  help: 'cyan',\n  warn: 'yellow',\n  debug: 'blue',\n  error: 'red'\n});\n\n// outputs red text\nconsole.log(colors.error(\"this is an error\"));\n\n// outputs yellow text\nconsole.log(colors.warn(\"this is a warning\"));\n```\n\n*Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in `colors`.

I made it so that when using [jQuery in node](https://github.com/tmtk75/node-jquery) setting css attributes via $.fn.css() would work. node-jquery uses [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) to create a DOM to use in node. jsdom uses CSSOM for styling, and CSSOM's implementation of the [CSSStyleDeclaration](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSStyleDeclaration) doesn't support [CSS2Properties](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties), which is how jQuery's [$.fn.css()](http://api.jquery.com/css/) operates.\n\n### Why not just issue a pull request?\n\nWell, NV wants to keep CSSOM fast (which I can appreciate) and CSS2Properties aren't required by the standard (though every browser has the interface). So I figured the path of least resistance would be to just modify this one class, publish it as a node module (that requires CSSOM) and then make a pull request of jsdom to use it.\n\n### How do I test this code?\n\n`npm test` should do the trick, assuming you have the dev dependencies installed:\n\n```\n$ npm test\n\ntests\n✔ Verify Has Properties\n✔ Verify Has Functions\n✔ Verify Has Special Properties\n✔ Test From Style String\n✔ Test From Properties\n✔ Test Shorthand Properties\n✔ Test width and height Properties and null and empty strings\n✔ Test Implicit Properties\n```\n"},"currently-unhandled@0.4.1":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/currently-unhandled","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/jamestalmage/currently-unhandled/raw/master/license","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"James Talmage","email":"james@talmage.io","url":"github.com/jamestalmage","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/currently-unhandled","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/currently-unhandled/license","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) James Talmage <james@talmage.io> (github.com/jamestalmage)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Available in npm as *errno*.\n\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno)\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)\n\n* [errno exposed](#errnoexposed)\n* [Custom errors](#customerrors)\n\n<a name=\"errnoexposed\"></a>\n## errno exposed\n\nEver find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.\n\n**By errno:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').errno[3]\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 3,\n//     \"code\": \"EACCES\",\n//     \"description\": \"permission denied\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**By code:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 53,\n//     \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n//     \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**Make your errors more descriptive:**\n\n```js\nvar errno = require('errno')\n\nfunction errmsg(err) {\n  var str = 'Error: '\n  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno\n  if (errno.errno[err.errno])\n    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description\n  else\n    str += err.message\n\n  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property\n  if (err.path)\n    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'\n\n  return str\n}\n\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nfs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {\n  if (err)\n    console.log(errmsg(err))\n})\n```\n\n**Use as a command line tool:**\n\n```\n~ $ errno 53\n{\n  \"errno\": 53,\n  \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n  \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n}\n~ $ errno EROFS\n{\n  \"errno\": 56,\n  \"code\": \"EROFS\",\n  \"description\": \"read-only file system\"\n}\n~ $ errno foo\nNo such errno/code: \"foo\"\n```\n\nSupply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.\n\nYou will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.\n\n<a name=\"customerrors\"></a>\n## Custom errors\n\nUse `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.\n\n```js\nvar create = require('errno').custom.createError\nvar MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error\nvar SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError\nvar OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)\n\n// use them!\nif (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')\n\nif (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))\n```\n\nAlso available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))\n  // do something else\n})\n```\n\nThe resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI\n* [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n\n## Copyright & Licence\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\n\nMade available under the MIT licence:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It resolves `require(\"…\")`, `import \"…\"` and `export … from \"…\"` references to internal modules (i.e. not `node_modules`), to determine whether there is a cycle. If you're using a custom parser, the rule will use that to parse the dependencies. The rule takes a `skip` array of strings, that will be treated as regexps to skip checking files.\n\nAdditionally, with the `types` option enabled, you can detect and prevent `import type` cycles as well. This can be helpful, since the [Flow checker](https://flow.org) can exhibit unexpected behavior with such cycles.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"dependencies\"\n  ],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"dependencies/no-cyles\": [1, {\"skip\": [\"/spec/\", \"/vendor/\"], \"types\": true}]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `dependencies/no-unresolved`\n\nChecks that `require(\"…\")`, `require.resolve(…)`, `import \"…\"` and `export … from \"…\"` reference modules that exist. Takes an `ignore` array of modules to ignore.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"dependencies\"\n  ],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"dependencies/no-unresolved\": [1, {\"ignore\": [\"atom\"], \"paths\": [\"custom-path-to-search-for-modules\"]}]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `dependencies/require-json-ext`\n\nEnsures that modules are that are `.json` include their extension in the module id.

AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

It provides classes for easily building\nWebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but\nrather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing\n[Node](http://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction\nother than the standard [WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).\n\nIt also provides an abstraction for handling\n[EventSource](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) connections, which are\none-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They are\nbased on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies than\nWebSockets.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install faye-websocket\n```\n\n\n## Handling WebSocket connections in Node\n\nYou can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade\nrequests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes\nthe usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this\nis how you'd implement an echo server:\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),\n    http      = require('http');\n\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\nserver.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {\n  if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {\n    var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);\n    \n    ws.on('message', function(event) {\n      ws.send(event.data);\n    });\n    \n    ws.on('close', function(event) {\n      console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);\n      ws = null;\n    });\n  }\n});\n\nserver.listen(8000);\n```\n\n`WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the\n`ws.on('message', ...)` line with:\n\n```js\n    ws.pipe(ws);\n```\n\nNote that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting\nthrough an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you\ncall `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire\nhandshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer\nthe message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any\nbuffered messages will be sent to the client.\n\nIf you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the\n`onopen` event.\n\nIf the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to\nsend a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a\nmessage string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message\nis received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the\nclient does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns\n`false`.\n\n```js\nws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {\n  // fires when pong is received\n});\n```\n\n\n## Using the WebSocket client\n\nThe client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss`\nprotocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web\nbrowser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),\n    ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');\n\nws.on('open', function(event) {\n  console.log('open');\n  ws.send('Hello, world!');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function(event) {\n  console.log('message', event.data);\n});\n\nws.on('close', function(event) {\n  console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);\n  ws = null;\n});\n```\n\nThe WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the\nhandshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.\n\nTo connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy,\nincluding any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you\nrequire. Only the `origin` setting is required.\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {\n  proxy: {\n    origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',\n    headers: {'User-Agent': 'node'},\n    tls:     {cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt')}\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe `tls` value is a Node 'TLS options' object that will be passed to\n[`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).\n\n\n## Subprotocol negotiation\n\nThe WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application\nprotocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which\nprotocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you\nconstruct the socket:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']);\n```\n\nOn the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server\nsupports after the other constructor arguments:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']);\n```\n\nIf the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side\nsocket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.\n\n\n## Protocol extensions\n\nfaye-websocket is based on the\n[websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\nframework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the\n`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an\narray of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add\n[permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):\n\n```js\nvar deflate = require('permessage-deflate');\n\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, [], {extensions: [deflate]});\n```\n\n\n## Initialization options\n\nBoth the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in\nat initialization time, for example:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options);\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options);\n```\n\n`protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`.\n`options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:\n\n* `extensions` - an array of\n  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\n  compatible extensions, as described above\n* `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to\n  be sent during the handshake process\n* `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.\n  The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB.\n* `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,\n  measured in seconds\n\nThe client accepts some additional options:\n\n* `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above\n* `tls` - a Node 'TLS options' object containing TLS settings for the origin\n  server, this will be passed to\n  [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback)\n* `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{tls: {ca: value}}`\n\n\n## WebSocket API\n\nBoth server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.\n\n* <b>`on('open', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket connection is\n  established. Event has no attributes.\n* <b>`on('message', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket receives a\n  message. Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`\n  (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames).\n* <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error\n  due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,\n  you do not need to implement error recover.\n* <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the\n  server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b>`code`</b>\n  and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer\n  that closed the connection.\n* <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a\n  text or binary message over the connection to the other peer.\n* <b>`ping(message, function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an optional\n  message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received.\n* <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status\n  code and reason text, both of which are optional.\n* <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`\n  protocol the connection is using.\n* <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol\n  the socket is using.\n\n\n## Handling EventSource connections in Node\n\nEventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they\nonly allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API.\nEventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each\nmessage has an optional event-type and ID.\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),\n    EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,\n    http        = require('http');\n\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\nserver.on('request', function(request, response) {\n  if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {\n    var es = new EventSource(request, response);\n    console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);\n    \n    // Periodically send messages\n    var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);\n    \n    es.on('close', function() {\n      clearInterval(loop);\n      es = null;\n    });\n  \n  } else {\n    // Normal HTTP request\n    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n    response.end('Hello');\n  }\n});\n\nserver.listen(8000);\n```\n\nThe `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default\nevent-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification`\nevent with ID `99`:\n\n```js\nes.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'});\n```\n\nThe `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:\n\n* <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the\n  EventSource.\n* <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the\n  client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection\n  to determine which messages need resending.\n\nWhen you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass\nconfiguration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:\n\n* <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the\n  EventSource response.\n* <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it\n  should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect.\n* <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send\n  'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts\n  set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.\n\nFor example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings\nevery 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:\n\n```js\nvar es = new EventSource(request, response, {\n  headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},\n  ping:    15,\n  retry:   10\n});\n```\n\nYou can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike\nWebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send\nsome data over the wire to keep the connection alive.\n\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},"form-data@2.3.3":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/form-data/form-data","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/form-data/form-data/raw/master/License","parents":"request:eoc-app","publisher":"Felix Geisendörfer","email":"felix@debuggable.com","url":"http://debuggable.com/","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/request/node_modules/form-data","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/request/node_modules/form-data/License","licenseText":"Copyright (c) 2012 Felix Geisendörfer (felix@debuggable.com) and contributors\n\n Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.\n\n  - `appname` the name of the application (required.)\n  - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.\n  - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:\n    - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)\n    - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)\n    - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)\n  - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.\n\nAn example:\n\n```javascript\ngrowly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [\n    { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },\n    { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false }\n], function(err) {\n    console.log(err || 'Registration successful!');\n});\n```\n\n### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###\n\nSends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.\n\n  - `text` the body of the notification.\n  - `opts` an object with the following properties:\n    - `.title` title of the notification.\n    - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.\n    - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)\n    - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)\n    - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).\n    - `.coalescingId` replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.\n  - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)\n\nAn example:\n\n```javascript\n/* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */\ngrowly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {\n    console.log('Action:', action);\n});\n```\n\n### Growly.setHost(host, port) ###\n\nSet the host and port that Growl (GNTP) requests will be sent to. Using this method is optional since GNTP defaults to using host 'localhost' and port 23053.\n\n## License ##\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Ibrahim Al-Rajhi <abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This shim is primarily useful if you want ES6 `Reflect`\nsupport on older browsers or versions of node.js < v6.0.0, or if you want\nES6 `Proxy` support on versions of node.js < v6.0.0.\n\n**May 2016 update**: the recently released [V8 v4.9](http://v8project.blogspot.com.au/2016/01/v8-release-49.html) includes native support for ES2015 Proxies and Reflect, making this library obsolete for environments that embed V8 4.9 or newer (like Chrome 49 and Node v6.0). Node v5.10.x or lower still requires this polyfill for proper ES6 Proxy support.\n\nRead [Why should I use this library?](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/wiki)\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nFor node.js, install via [npm](http://npmjs.org):\n\n    npm install harmony-reflect\n\nThen:\n\n    node --harmony-proxies\n    > var Reflect = require('harmony-reflect');\n\nSee [release notes](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/blob/master/RELNOTES.md) for changes to the npm releases.\n\nTo use in a browser, just download the single reflect.js file. After loading\n\n    <script src=\"reflect.js\"></script>\n\na global object `Reflect` is defined that contains reflection methods as defined in the [ES6 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-reflect-object).\n\nThis library also updates the \"harmony-era\" `Proxy` object in the V8 engine\n(also used in node.js) to follow the latest [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) spec.\nTo create such a proxy, call:\n\n    var proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);\n\nSee below for a list of spec incompatibilities and other gotcha's.\n\nAPI Docs\n========\n\nThis module exports an object named `Reflect` and updates the global `Proxy` object (if it exists) to be compatible with the latest ECMAScript 6 spec.\n\nThe ECMAScript 6 Proxy API allows one to intercept various operations on Javascript objects.\n\n  * Overview of all [supported traps](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/traps.md) on proxies\n  * The [Reflect API](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/api.md) \n  * The Proxy [Handler API](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/handler_api.md)\n  \nCompatibility\n=============\n\nThe `Reflect` API, with support for proxies, was tested on:\n\n  * Firefox (>= v4.0)\n  * `node --harmony_proxies` (>= v0.7.8)\n  * `iojs --harmony_proxies` (>= 2.3.0)\n  * `v8 --harmony_proxies` (>= v3.6)\n  * Any recent `js` spidermonkey shell\n\nIf you need only `Reflect` and not an up-to-date `Proxy` object, this\nlibrary should work on any modern ES5 engine (including all browsers).\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\n  * Chrome (>= v19 && <= v37) used to support proxies behind a flag\n    (`chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony`) but Chrome v38  [removed](https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=1543#c44) the `Proxy` constructor. As a result, this library cannot patch the harmony-era `Proxy` object on Chrome v38 or above. If you're working with Chromium directly, it's still possible to enable proxies using `chromium-browser --js-flags=\"--harmony_proxies\"`.\n  * In older versions of V8, the `Proxy` constructor was enabled by\n    default when starting V8 with `--harmony`. For recent versions of V8,\n    `Proxy` must be explicitly enabled with `--harmony_proxies`.\n\nDependencies\n============\n\n  *  ECMAScript 5/strict\n  *  To emulate direct proxies:\n    *  old Harmony [Proxies](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proxies)\n    *  Harmony [WeakMaps](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:weak_maps)\n\nAfter loading `reflect.js` into your page or other JS environment, be aware that the following globals are patched to be able to recognize emulated direct proxies:\n\n    Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor\n    Object.defineProperty\n    Object.defineProperties\n    Object.getOwnPropertyNames\n    Object.getOwnPropertySymbols\n    Object.keys\n    Object.{get,set}PrototypeOf\n    Object.assign\n    Object.{freeze,seal,preventExtensions}\n    Object.{isFrozen,isSealed,isExtensible}\n    Object.prototype.valueOf\n    Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf\n    Object.prototype.toString\n    Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty\n    Function.prototype.toString\n    Date.prototype.toString\n    Array.isArray\n    Array.prototype.concat\n    Proxy\n    Reflect\n\n:warning: In node.js, when you `require('harmony-reflect')`, only the current\nmodule's globals are patched. If you pass an emulated direct proxy to an external module, and that module uses the unpatched globals, the module may not interact with the proxy according to the latest ES6 Proxy API, instead falling\nback on the old pre-ES6 Proxy API. This can cause bugs, e.g. the built-in `Array.isArray` will return `false` when passed a proxy-for-array, while the\npatched `Array.isArray` will return true. I know of no good fix to reliably patch the globals for all node modules. If you do, let me know.\n\nExamples\n========\n\nThe [examples](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/examples) directory contains a number of examples demonstrating the use of proxies:\n\n  * membranes: wrappers that transitively isolate two object-graphs.\n  * observer: a self-hosted implementation of the ES7 `Object.observe` notification mechanism.\n  * profiler: a simple profiler to collect usage statistics of an object.\n\nOther example uses of proxies (not done by me, but using this library):\n\n  * supporting [negative array indices](https://github.com/sindresorhus/negative-array) a la Python\n  * [tpyo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/tpyo): using proxies to correct typo's in JS property names\n  * [persistent objects](http://tagtree.tv/es6-proxies): shows how one might go about using proxies to save updates to objects in a database incrementally\n  * [defaultdict](https://github.com/greenify/defaultdict2): default values for new keys in objects (as known from Python)\n\nFor more examples of proxies, and a good overview of their design rationale, I recommend reading [Axel Rauschmayer's blog post on proxies](http://www.2ality.com/2014/12/es6-proxies.html).\n\nProxy Handler API\n=================\n\nThe sister project [proxy-handlers](https://github.com/tvcutsem/proxy-handlers)\ndefines a number of predefined Proxy handlers as \"abstract classes\" that your \ncode can \"subclass\" The goal is to minimize the number of traps that your proxy\nhandlers must implement.\n\nSpec Incompatibilities and other gotcha's\n=========================================\n\nThis library differs from the [ECMAScript 2016 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html) as follows:\n\n  * In ES7, the `enumerate()` trap, and the corresponding `Reflect.enumerate()` method, have been [removed](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/161).\n    This shim still supports the trap.\n  * The ES7 (and ES6) spec contains a \n    [bug](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/666) that leads to missing\n    invariant checks in the getOwnPropertyDescriptor, defineProperty and deleteProperty traps. This library already contains the patch referred\n    to in [this issue](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/666).\n\nThis library differs from the [ECMAScript 2015 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) as follows:\n\n  * In ES6, `Proxy` is a constructor function that _requires_ the use\n    of `new`. That is, you must write `new Proxy(target, handler)`. This library\n    exports `Proxy` as an ordinary function which may be called with or without using the `new` operator.\n    \n  * In ES6, `Function.prototype.toString` and `Date.prototype.toString` do not\n    operate transparently on Proxies. This shim patches those functions so that\n    stringifying a Proxy-for-a-function or a Proxy-for-a-date \"unwraps\" the\n    proxy and instead stringifies the target of the Proxy. This behavior may\n    change in the future to be more spec-compatible.\n    \n  * This library does not shim [Symbol objects](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-symbol-objects).\n    On modern V8 or io.js which supports Symbol objects natively, due to a bug in V8, Symbols and Proxies\n    don't play well together. [Read more](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/issues/57).\n  \n  * Proxies-for-arrays are serialized as JSON objects rather than as JSON arrays. That is, `JSON.stringify(new Proxy([], {}))` returns \"{}\" rather than \"[]\".

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling\n"},"human-interval@0.1.6":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/rschmukler/human-interval","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/rschmukler/human-interval","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Ryan Schmukler","email":"ryan@slingingcode.com","url":"http://slingingcode.com/","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/human-interval","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/human-interval/README.md","licenseText":"# Human Interval\nHuman readable interval parser for Node.js/the Browser.\n\nHeavily inspired by\n[matthewmueller/date](http://github.com/matthewmueller/date).\n\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```js\nvar humanInterval = require('human-interval');\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  // Do something crazy!\n}, humanInterval('three minutes'));\n\n```\n\n## More sophisticated examples\n\nhumanInterval understands all of the following examples:\n\n```js\nhumanInterval('one minute');\nhumanInterval('1.5 minutes');\nhumanInterval('3 days and 4 hours');\nhumanInterval('3 days, 4 hours and 36 seconds');\n```\n\n## The full list\n\n### Supported Units\n\nHuman Interval supports the following units\n\n- `seconds`\n- `minutes`\n- `hours`\n- `days`\n- `weeks`\n- `months` -- assumes 30 days\n- `years` -- assumes 365 days\n\n### Wordy Numbers\n\nHuman Interval supports numbers up to ten being written out in English.

In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor).

Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n\n  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n\n  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,\n  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or\n  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not\n  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n\n  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation\n  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer\n  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions\n  or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n\n  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n  CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\n<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>\n"},"media-typer@0.3.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/jshttp/media-typer","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/jshttp/media-typer/raw/master/LICENSE","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Douglas Christopher Wilson","email":"doug@somethingdoug.com","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/media-typer","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/media-typer/LICENSE","licenseText":"(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Douglas Christopher Wilson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n"},"mem@4.3.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/mem","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/mem/raw/master/license","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Sindre Sorhus","email":"sindresorhus@gmail.com","url":"sindresorhus.com","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/mem","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/mem/license","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) Sindre Sorhus <sindresorhus@gmail.com> (sindresorhus.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

[![Build][]][1] [![Coverage][]][2]\n===============\n\nCompare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers\nin the way a human being would in sort order.\nThis is described as a \"natural ordering\".\n\n```text\nStandard sorting:   Natural order sorting:\n    img1.png            img1.png\n    img10.png           img2.png\n    img12.png           img10.png\n    img2.png            img12.png\n```\n\nString.naturalCompare returns a number indicating\nwhether a reference string comes before or after or is the same\nas the given string in sort order.\nUse it with builtin sort() function.\n\n\n\n### Installation\n\n- In browser\n\n```html\n<script src=min.natural-compare.js></script>\n```\n\n- In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\"natural-compare-lite\")\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```javascript\n// Simple case sensitive example\nvar a = [\"z1.doc\", \"z10.doc\", \"z17.doc\", \"z2.doc\", \"z23.doc\", \"z3.doc\"];\na.sort(String.naturalCompare);\n// [\"z1.doc\", \"z2.doc\", \"z3.doc\", \"z10.doc\", \"z17.doc\", \"z23.doc\"]\n\n// Use wrapper function for case insensitivity\na.sort(function(a, b){\n  return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase());\n})\n\n// In most cases we want to sort an array of objects\nvar a = [ {\"street\":\"350 5th Ave\", \"room\":\"A-1021\"}\n        , {\"street\":\"350 5th Ave\", \"room\":\"A-21046-b\"} ];\n\n// sort by street, then by room\na.sort(function(a, b){\n  return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room);\n})\n\n// When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()),\n// it is best for performance to keep\n// transformed key in that object.\n// There are no need to do text transformation\n// on each comparision when sorting.\nvar a = [ {\"make\":\"Audi\", \"model\":\"A6\"}\n        , {\"make\":\"Kia\",  \"model\":\"Rio\"} ];\n\n// sort by make, then by model\na.map(function(car){\n  car.sort_key = (car.make + \" \" + car.model).toLowerCase();\n})\na.sort(function(a, b){\n  return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key);\n})\n```\n\n- Works well with dates in ISO format eg \"Rev 2012-07-26.doc\".\n\n\n### Custom alphabet\n\nIt is possible to configure a custom alphabet\nto achieve a desired order.\n\n```javascript\n// Estonian alphabet\nString.alphabet = \"ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy\"\n[\"t\", \"z\", \"x\", \"õ\"].sort(String.naturalCompare)\n// [\"z\", \"t\", \"õ\", \"x\"]\n\n// Russian alphabet\nString.alphabet = \"АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя\"\n[\"Ё\", \"А\", \"Б\"].sort(String.naturalCompare)\n// [\"А\", \"Б\", \"Ё\"]\n```\n\n\nExternal links\n--------------\n\n-   [GitHub repo][https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite]\n-   [jsperf test](http://jsperf.com/natural-sort-2/12)\n\n\nLicence\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2015 Lauri Rooden &lt;lauri@rooden.ee&gt;

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n"},"node-gyp@3.8.0":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/raw/master/LICENSE","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Nathan Rajlich","email":"nathan@tootallnate.net","url":"http://tootallnate.net","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/node-gyp","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/node-gyp/LICENSE","licenseText":"(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Nathan Rajlich <nathan@tootallnate.net>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

Instead, the local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within an npm script (such as `npm start`) or using `npx nodemon`.\n\n# Usage\n\nnodemon wraps your application, so you can pass all the arguments you would normally pass to your app:\n\n```bash\nnodemon [your node app]\n```\n\nFor CLI options, use the `-h` (or `--help`) argument:\n\n```bash\nnodemon -h\n```\n\nUsing nodemon is simple, if my application accepted a host and port as the arguments, I would start it as so:\n\n```bash\nnodemon ./server.js localhost 8080\n```\n\nAny output from this script is prefixed with `[nodemon]`, otherwise all output from your application, errors included, will be echoed out as expected.\n\nIf no script is given, nodemon will test for a `package.json` file and if found, will run the file associated with the *main* property ([ref](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/14)).\n\nYou can also pass the `inspect` flag to node through the command line as you would normally:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --inspect ./server.js 80\n```\n\nIf you have a `package.json` file for your app, you can omit the main script entirely and nodemon will read the `package.json` for the `main` property and use that value as the app.\n\nnodemon will also search for the `scripts.start` property in `package.json` (as of nodemon 1.1.x).\n\nAlso check out the [FAQ](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md) or [issues](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues) for nodemon.\n\n## Automatic re-running\n\nnodemon was originally written to restart hanging processes such as web servers, but now supports apps that cleanly exit. If your script exits cleanly, nodemon will continue to monitor the directory (or directories) and restart the script if there are any changes.\n\n## Manual restarting\n\nWhilst nodemon is running, if you need to manually restart your application, instead of stopping and restart nodemon, you can type `rs` with a carriage return, and nodemon will restart your process.\n\n## Config files\n\nnodemon supports local and global configuration files. These are usually named `nodemon.json` and can be located in the current working directory or in your home directory. An alternative local configuration file can be specified with the `--config <file>` option.\n\nThe specificity is as follows, so that a command line argument will always override the config file settings:\n\n- command line arguments\n- local config\n- global config\n\nA config file can take any of the command line arguments as JSON key values, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"verbose\": true,\n  \"ignore\": [\"*.test.js\", \"fixtures/*\"],\n  \"execMap\": {\n    \"rb\": \"ruby\",\n    \"pde\": \"processing --sketch={{pwd}} --run\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe above `nodemon.json` file might be my global config so that I have support for ruby files and processing files, and I can run `nodemon demo.pde` and nodemon will automatically know how to run the script even though out of the box support for processing scripts.\n\nA further example of options can be seen in [sample-nodemon.md](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/sample-nodemon.md)\n\n### package.json\n\nIf you want to keep all your package configurations in one place, nodemon supports using `package.json` for configuration.\nSpecify the config in the same format as you would for a config file but under `nodemonConfig` in the `package.json` file, for example, take the following `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"nodemon\",\n  \"homepage\": \"http://nodemon.io\",\n  \"...\": \"... other standard package.json values\",\n  \"nodemonConfig\": {\n    \"ignore\": [\"test/*\", \"docs/*\"],\n    \"delay\": \"2500\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that if you specify a `--config` file or provide a local `nodemon.json` any `package.json` config is ignored.\n\n*This section needs better documentation, but for now you can also see `nodemon --help config` ([also here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/cli/config.txt))*.\n\n## Using nodemon as a module\n\nPlease see [doc/requireable.md](doc/requireable.md)\n\n## Using nodemon as child process\n\nPlease see [doc/events.md](doc/events.md#Using_nodemon_as_child_process)\n\n## Running non-node scripts\n\nnodemon can also be used to execute and monitor other programs. nodemon will read the file extension of the script being run and monitor that extension instead of `.js` if there's no `nodemon.json`:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --exec \"python -v\" ./app.py\n```\n\nNow nodemon will run `app.py` with python in verbose mode (note that if you're not passing args to the exec program, you don't need the quotes), and look for new or modified files with the `.py` extension.\n\n### Default executables\n\nUsing the `nodemon.json` config file, you can define your own default executables using the `execMap` property. This is particularly useful if you're working with a language that isn't supported by default by nodemon.\n\nTo add support for nodemon to know about the `.pl` extension (for Perl), the `nodemon.json` file would add:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"execMap\": {\n    \"pl\": \"perl\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow running the following, nodemon will know to use `perl` as the executable:\n\n```bash\nnodemon script.pl\n```\n\nIt's generally recommended to use the global `nodemon.json` to add your own `execMap` options. However, if there's a common default that's missing, this can be merged in to the project so that nodemon supports it by default, by changing [default.js](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/lib/config/defaults.js) and sending a pull request.\n\n## Monitoring multiple directories\n\nBy default nodemon monitors the current working directory. If you want to take control of that option, use the `--watch` option to add specific paths:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --watch app --watch libs app/server.js\n```\n\nNow nodemon will only restart if there are changes in the `./app` or `./libs` directory. By default nodemon will traverse sub-directories, so there's no need in explicitly including sub-directories.\n\nDon't use unix globbing to pass multiple directories, e.g `--watch ./lib/*`, it won't work. You need a `--watch` flag per directory watched.\n\n## Specifying extension watch list\n\nBy default, nodemon looks for files with the `.js`, `.mjs`, `.coffee`, `.litcoffee`, and `.json` extensions. If you use the `--exec` option and monitor `app.py` nodemon will monitor files with the extension of `.py`. However, you can specify your own list with the `-e` (or `--ext`) switch like so:\n\n```bash\nnodemon -e js,jade\n```\n\nNow nodemon will restart on any changes to files in the directory (or subdirectories) with the extensions `.js`, `.jade`.\n\n## Ignoring files\n\nBy default, nodemon will only restart when a `.js` JavaScript file changes. In some cases you will want to ignore some specific files, directories or file patterns, to prevent nodemon from prematurely restarting your application.\n\nThis can be done via the command line:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --ignore lib/ --ignore tests/\n```\n\nOr specific files can be ignored:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --ignore lib/app.js\n```\n\nPatterns can also be ignored (but be sure to quote the arguments):\n\n```bash\nnodemon --ignore 'lib/*.js'\n```\n\nNote that by default, nodemon will ignore the `.git`, `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `.nyc_output`, `coverage` and `.sass-cache` directories and *add* your ignored patterns to the list. If you want to indeed watch a directory like `node_modules`, you need to [override the underlying default ignore rules](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md#overriding-the-underlying-default-ignore-rules).\n\n## Application isn't restarting\n\nIn some networked environments (such as a container running nodemon reading across a mounted drive), you will need to use the `legacyWatch: true` which enables Chokidar's polling.\n\nVia the CLI, use either `--legacy-watch` or `-L` for short:\n\n```bash\nnodemon -L\n```\n\nThough this should be a last resort as it will poll every file it can find.\n\n## Delaying restarting\n\nIn some situations, you may want to wait until a number of files have changed. The timeout before checking for new file changes is 1 second. If you're uploading a number of files and it's taking some number of seconds, this could cause your app to restart multiple times unnecessarily.\n\nTo add an extra throttle, or delay restarting, use the `--delay` command:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 10 server.js\n```\n\nFor more precision, milliseconds can be specified.  Either as a float:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 2.5 server.js\n```\n\nOr using the time specifier (ms):\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 2500ms server.js\n```\n\nThe delay figure is number of seconds (or milliseconds, if specified) to delay before restarting. So nodemon will only restart your app the given number of seconds after the *last* file change.\n\nIf you are setting this value in `nodemon.json`, the value will always be interpreted in milliseconds. E.g., the following are equivalent:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 2.5\n\n{\n  \"delay\": \"2500\"\n}\n```\n\n## Gracefully reloading down your script\n\nIt is possible to have nodemon send any signal that you specify to your application.\n\n```bash\nnodemon --signal SIGHUP server.js\n```\n\nYour application can handle the signal as follows.\n\n```js\nprocess.once(\"SIGHUP\", function () {\n  reloadSomeConfiguration();\n})\n```\n\nPlease note that nodemon will send this signal to every process in the process tree.\n\nIf you are using `cluster`, then each workers (as well as the master) will receive the signal. If you wish to terminate all workers on receiving a `SIGHUP`, a common pattern is to catch the `SIGHUP` in the master, and forward `SIGTERM` to all workers, while ensuring that all workers ignore `SIGHUP`.\n\n```js\nif (cluster.isMaster) {\n  process.on(\"SIGHUP\", function () {\n    for (const worker of Object.values(cluster.workers)) {\n      worker.process.kill(\"SIGTERM\");\n    }\n  });\n} else {\n  process.on(\"SIGHUP\", function() {})\n}\n```\n\n## Controlling shutdown of your script\n\nnodemon sends a kill signal to your application when it sees a file update. If you need to clean up on shutdown inside your script you can capture the kill signal and handle it yourself.\n\nThe following example will listen once for the `SIGUSR2` signal (used by nodemon to restart), run the clean up process and then kill itself for nodemon to continue control:\n\n```js\nprocess.once('SIGUSR2', function () {\n  gracefulShutdown(function () {\n    process.kill(process.pid, 'SIGUSR2');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nNote that the `process.kill` is *only* called once your shutdown jobs are complete. Hat tip to [Benjie Gillam](http://www.benjiegillam.com/2011/08/node-js-clean-restart-and-faster-development-with-nodemon/) for writing this technique up.\n\n## Triggering events when nodemon state changes\n\nIf you want growl like notifications when nodemon restarts or to trigger an action when an event happens, then you can either `require` nodemon or add event actions to your `nodemon.json` file.\n\nFor example, to trigger a notification on a Mac when nodemon restarts, `nodemon.json` looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"events\": {\n    \"restart\": \"osascript -e 'display notification \\\"app restarted\\\" with title \\\"nodemon\\\"'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA full list of available events is listed on the [event states wiki](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/wiki/Events#states). Note that you can bind to both states and messages.\n\n## Pipe output to somewhere else\n\n```js\nnodemon({\n  script: ...,\n  stdout: false // important: this tells nodemon not to output to console\n}).on('readable', function() { // the `readable` event indicates that data is ready to pick up\n  this.stdout.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));\n  this.stderr.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('err.txt'));\n});\n```\n\n## Using nodemon in your gulp workflow\n\nCheck out the [gulp-nodemon](https://github.com/JacksonGariety/gulp-nodemon) plugin to integrate nodemon with the rest of your project's gulp workflow.\n\n## Using nodemon in your Grunt workflow\n\nCheck out the [grunt-nodemon](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon) plugin to integrate nodemon with the rest of your project's grunt workflow.\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n> nodemon, is it pronounced: node-mon, no-demon or node-e-mon (like pokémon)?\n\nWell...I've been asked this many times before. I like that I've been asked this before. There's been bets as to which one it actually is.\n\nThe answer is simple, but possibly frustrating. I'm not saying (how I pronounce it). It's up to you to call it as you like. All answers are correct :)\n\n## Design principles\n\n- Less flags is better\n- Works across all platforms\n- Less features\n- Let individuals build on top of nodemon\n- Offer all CLI functionality as an API\n- Contributions must have and pass tests\n\nNodemon is not perfect, and CLI arguments has sprawled beyond where I'm completely happy, but perhaps it can be reduced a little one day.\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee the [FAQ](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md) and please add your own questions if you think they would help others.\n\n## Backers\n\nThank you to all [our backers](https://opencollective.com/nodemon#backer)! 🙏\n\n[![nodemon backers](https://opencollective.com/nodemon/backers.svg?width=890)](https://opencollective.com/nodemon#backers)\n\n## Sponsors\n\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},"oauth@0.9.15":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth","licenseUrl":"http://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth/raw/master/LICENSE","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Ciaran Jessup","email":"ciaranj@gmail.com","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/oauth","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/oauth/LICENSE","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) <2010-2012> <Ciaran Jessup>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If you don't know what sessionStore to use, have a look at [this list](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/wiki#session-stores).\nAlso be sure to use the same sessionStore or at least a connection to *the same collection/table/whatever*. And don't forget your `express.session()` middleware:\n`app.use(express.session({ store: awesomeSessionStore }));`\nFor further info about this middleware see [the official documentation](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/session.html#session).\n\nYou can also check the simple example below using a redis store.\n\n```javascript\n//in your app.js\nvar sessionStore = new redisStore();\n\napp.use(session({\n  key: 'express.sid',\n  store: sessionStore,\n  secret: 'keyboard cat'\n}));\n\n//in your passport.socketio setup\n//With Socket.io >= 1.0 (you will have the same setup for Socket.io <1)\nio.use(passportSocketIo.authorize({\n  cookieParser: require('cookie-parser'), //optional your cookie-parser middleware function. Defaults to require('cookie-parser')\n  key:          'express.sid',       //make sure is the same as in your session settings in app.js\n  secret:       'keyboard cat',      //make sure is the same as in your session settings in app.js\n  store:        sessionStore,        //you need to use the same sessionStore you defined in the app.use(session({... in app.js\n  success:      onAuthorizeSuccess,  // *optional* callback on success\n  fail:         onAuthorizeFail,     // *optional* callback on fail/error\n}));\n\n```\n\n### `cookieParser` [function] **optional**:\nOptional cookieParser from express. Express 3 is `express.cookieParser` in Express 4 `require('cookie-parser')`.\n\nDefaults to `require('cookie-parser')`.\n\n### `key` [string] **optional**:\nDefaults to `'connect.sid'`. But you're always better of to be sure and set your own key. Don't forget to also change it in your `express.session()`:\n`app.use(express.session({ key: 'your.sid-key' }));`\n\n### `secret` [string] **optional**:\nAs with `key`, also the secret you provide is optional. *But:* be sure to have one. That's always safer. You can set it like the key:\n`app.use(express.session({ secret: 'pinkie ate my cupcakes!' }));`\n\n### `passport` [function] **optional**:\nDefaults to `require('passport')`. If you want, you can provide your own instance of passport for whatever reason.\n\n### `success` [function] **optional**:\nCallback which will be called everytime a *authorized* user successfuly connects to your socket.io instance. **Always** be sure to accept/reject the connection.\nFor that, there are two parameters: `function(data[object], accept[function])`. `data` contains all the user-information from passport.\nThe second parameter is for accepting/rejecting connections. Use it like this if you use socket.io under 1.0:\n```javascript\n// accept connection\naccept(null, true);\n\n// reject connection (for whatever reason)\naccept(null, false);\n\n\n```\n\nAnd like this if you use the newest version of socket.io@1.X\n```javascript\n// accept connection\naccept();\n\n// reject connection (for whatever reason)\naccept(new Error('optional reason'));\n\n\n```\n\n\n### `fail` [function] **optional**:\nThe name of this callback may be a little confusing. While it is called when a not-authorized-user connects, it is also called when there's a error.\nFor debugging reasons you are provided with two additional parameters `function(data[object], message[string], error[bool], accept[function])`: (socket.io @ < 1.X)\n```javascript\n/* ... */\nfunction onAuthorizeFail(data, message, error, accept){\n  // error indicates whether the fail is due to an error or just a unauthorized client\n  if(error){\n    throw new Error(message);\n  } else {\n    console.log(message);\n    // the same accept-method as above in the success-callback\n    accept(null, false);\n  }\n}\n\n// or\n// This function accepts every client unless there's an error\nfunction onAuthorizeFail(data, message, error, accept){\n  console.log(message);\n  accept(null, !error);\n}\n```\n\nSocket.io@1.X:\n```javascript\nfunction onAuthorizeFail(data, message, error, accept){\n  // error indicates whether the fail is due to an error or just a unauthorized client\n  if(error)  throw new Error(message);\n  // send the (not-fatal) error-message to the client and deny the connection\n  return accept(new Error(message));\n}\n\n// or\n// This function accepts every client unless there's an critical error\nfunction onAuthorizeFail(data, message, error, accept){\n  if(error)  throw new Error(message);\n  return accept();\n}\n```\n\n\nYou can use the `message` parameter for debugging/logging/etc uses.\n\n## `socket.handshake.user` (prior to v1)\nThis property was removed in v1. See `socket.request.user`\n\n## `socket.request.user` (as of v1)\nThis property is always available from inside a `io.on('connection')` handler. If the user is authorized via passport, you can access all the properties from there.\n**Plus** you have the `socket.request.user.logged_in` property which tells you whether the user is currently authorized or not.\n\n**Note:** This property was named socket.handshake.user prior to v1\n\n## Additional methods\n\n### `passportSocketIo.filterSocketsByUser`\nThis function gives you the ability to filter all connected sockets via a user property. Needs two parameters `function(io, function(user))`. Example:\n```javascript\npassportSocketIo.filterSocketsByUser(io, function(user){\n  return user.gender === 'female';\n}).forEach(function(socket){\n  socket.emit('messsage', 'hello, woman!');\n});\n```\n\n## CORS-Workaround:\nIf you happen to have to work with Cross-Origin-Requests (marked by socket.io v0.9 as `handshake.xdomain` and by socket.io v1.0 as `request.xdomain`) then here's a workaround:\n\n### Clientside:\nYou have to provide the session-cookie. If you haven't set a name yet, do it like this: `app.use(express.session({ key: 'your.sid-key' }));`\n```javascript\n// Note: ther's no readCookie-function built in.\n// Get your own in the internetz\nsocket = io.connect('//' + window.location.host, {\n  query: 'session_id=' + readCookie('your.sid-key')\n});\n```\n\n### Serverside:\nNope, there's nothing to do on the server side. Just be sure that the cookies names match.\n\n\n## Notes:\n* Does **NOT** support cookie-based sessions. eg: `express.cookieSession`\n* If the connection fails, check if you are requesting from a client via CORS. Check `socket.handshake.xdomain === true` (`socket.request.xdomain === true` with socket.io v1) as there are no cookies sent. For a workaround look at the code above.\n\n\n## Contribute\nYou are always welcome to open an issue or provide a pull-request!\nAlso check out the unit tests:\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\n## License\nLicensed under the MIT-License.\n2012-2013 José F.

Scott Ananian","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/pn","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/pn/README.md","licenseText":"# pn\n[![NPM][NPM1]][NPM2]\n\n[![Build Status][1]][2]\n\nThe `pn` library gives you the Promise-using node standard library\nyou've always dreamed of.  Think \"Promised Node\" when saying it.\n\nJust about every node standard library method that takes a callback will now\nreturn a `Promise` iff no callback is supplied.  But existing code\nthat passes callbacks will still work fine --- and fast:  No unnecessary\n`Promise`s are created if you supply a callback.\n\nThe wrappers are generated automatically by a script, with a table to\nhandle exceptions and odd cases.  See below for more details.\n\n## Installation\n```\nnpm install pn\n```\n## Usage\n```\nvar fs = require('pn/fs');\nfs.writeFile('foo', 'bar', 'utf-8').then(function() { console.log('done'); });\n// But you can use callbacks, too -- existing code won't break.\nfs.writeFile('foo', 'bat', 'utf-8', function(err) { console.log('yay'); });\n```\n\nThis library uses node native promises (ie `global.Promise`) by\ndefault, and thus works with node >= 0.11.\n\nYou can use [`core-js`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/core-js) or\n[`es6-shim`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/es6-shim)\nto add ES6 Promises to earlier versions of node, for example:\n```\nrequire('es6-shim');\nvar fs = require('pn/fs');\n```\nJust be sure that `es6-shim` is loaded before the `pn` package in that\ncase.\n\nYou might also want to look into packages like\n[`prfun`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/prfun)\nwhich add some helpers to make working with native promises much more\nfun.\n\nIn particular, the `Promise#done` method is very useful when\ndebugging, at least until v8's native Promise debugging\ncapabilities are completed.\n\n## Custom Promise types\n\nYou can also specify a custom `Promise` type to use, as follows:\n```\nvar MyPromise = require('prfun');  // Use prfun's Promises, for example.\nrequire('pn/_promise')(MyPromise); // This only needs to be done once.\n```\n\n## Exceptions and odd cases\n\nThe wrappers are automatically generated by `scripts/generate.js`;\nthere is a table in that file which specifies all the odd cases.\n\nIn general: if the node API has a callback which takes multiple\nvalue arguments, the `Promise` returned will be an object with\nnamed fields corresponding to the different values. If the node\nAPI takes a callback *and* returns a value, `pn` will return\nthe original value with a nonenumerable field named `promise`\ncorresponding to the callback.  Combining these two cases:\n```\nvar child_process = require('pn/child_process');\nvar cp = child_process.execFile('true');\nconsole.log('pid', cp.pid);\ncp.promise.then(function(result) {\n  console.log('stdout: ', result.stdout);\n  console.log('stderr: ', result.stderr);\n});\n```\n\n* `child_process`: The `exec` and `execFile` methods promise a object\n  with fields named `stdout` and `stderr`.  They return a `ChildProcess`\n  object with a nonenumerable field named `promise` corresponding to the\n  callback.\n* `crypto`: The `randomBytes` and `pseudoRandomBytes` methods are\n  now always asynchronous, returning a `Promise` if no callback\n  is supplied.  Use the new `randomBytesSync` and `pseudoRandomBytesSync`\n  methods if you want synchronous computation.  *This is backwards\n  incompatible with existing node code.*\n* `dns`: The `lookupService` method promises an object with\n  fields named `hostname` and `service`.\n* `fs`: The `exists` method doesn't pass an error to its callback.\n  The promisied version will never reject.  The `write` method promises\n  an object with fields named `written` and `data`.  The `read` method\n  promises an object with fields named `read` and `data`.\n* `http`, `https`: The `request` and `get` methods return a `ClientRequest`\n  object with a nonenumerable field named `promise`, which will\n  resolve to an `IncomingMessage` object.\n* `process`: You can defer computation to the next tick with\n  `require('pn/process').nextTick().then(function(){...})`\n* `tls`: The `connect` and `createServer` return objects with a\n  nonenumerable field named `promise`.\n\nThere are a few object methods which are not promisified by this\npackage:\n* `domain`: `Domain#bind`, `Domain#intercept`\n* `http`,`https`: `ClientRequest#setTimeout`, `IncomingMessage#setTimeout`,\n  `Server#setTimeout`, `ServerResponse#setTimeout`, `Server#listen`,\n  `Server#close`\n* `net`: `Server#listen`, `Server#close`, `Server#getConnections`,\n  `Socket#write`, `Socket#setTimeout`\n* `readline`: `Interface#question`\n* `stream`: `Writable#write`, `Writable#end`\n* `dgram`: `Socket#send`, `Socket#bind`.\n\n## Related packages\n\nHere are some other packages with similar aims:\n* [`promised-node`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/promised-node)\n* [`then-fs`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/then-fs)\n* [`final-fs`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/final-fs)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2014-2018 C.

It's is pretty much everything that ends up in the parsed result. Each node has these properties:\r\n\r\n* `type`: the type of the node (see below);\r\n* `value`: the node's value stripped of trailing whitespaces;\r\n* `sourceIndex`: 0-based index of the node start relative to the source start (excluding trailing whitespaces);\r\n* `before`: a string that contain a whitespace between the node start and the previous node end/source start;\r\n* `after`: a string that contain a whitespace between the node end and the next node start/source end;\r\n* `parent`: a link to this node's parent node (a container).\r\n\r\nA node can have one of these types (according to [the 2012 CSS3 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-css3-mediaqueries-20120619/)):\r\n\r\n* `media-query-list`: that is the root level node of the parsing result. A [container](#containers); its children can have types of `url` and `media-query`.\r\n* `url`: if a source is taken from a CSS `@import` rule, it will have a `url(...)` function call. The value of such node will be `url(http://uri-address)`, it is to be parsed separately.\r\n* `media-query`: such nodes correspond to each media query in a comma separated list. In the exapmle above there are two. Nodes of this type are [containers](#containers).\r\n* `media-type`: `screen`, `tv` and other media types.\r\n* `keyword`: `only`, `not` or `and` keyword.\r\n* `media-feature-expression`: an expression in parentheses that checks for a condition of a particular media feature. The value would be like this: `(max-width: 1000px)`. Such nodes are [containers](#containers). They always have a `media-feature` child node, but might not have a `value` child node (like in `screen and (color)`).\r\n* `media-feature`: a media feature, e.g. `max-width`.\r\n* `colon`: present if a media feature expression has a colon (e.g. `(min-width: 1000px)`, compared to `(color)`).\r\n* `value`: a media feature expression value, e.g. `100px` in `(max-width: 1000px)`.\r\n\r\n### Parsing details\r\n\r\npostcss-media-query-parser allows for cases of some **non-standard syntaxes** and tries its best to work them around. For example, in a media query from a code with SCSS syntax:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@media #{$media-type} and ( #{\"max-width\" + \": 10px\"} ) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`#{$media-type}` will be the node of type `media-type`, alghough `$media-type`'s value can be `only screen`. And inside `media-feature-expression` there will only be a `media-feature` type node with the value of `#{\"max-width\" + \": 10px\"}` (this example doesn't make much sense, it's for demo purpose).\r\n\r\nBut the result of parsing **malformed media queries** (such as with incorrect amount of closing parens, curly braces, etc.) can be unexpected. For exapmle, parsing:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@media ((min-width: -100px)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould return a media query list with the single `media-query` node that has no child nodes.\r\n\r\n## Containers\r\n\r\nContainers are [nodes](#nodes) that have other nodes as children. Container nodes have an additional property `nodes` which is an array of their child nodes. And also these methods:\r\n\r\n* `each(callback)` - traverses the direct child nodes of a container, calling `callback` function for each of them. Returns `false` if traversing has stopped by means of `callback` returning `false`, and `true` otherwise.\r\n* `walk([filter, ]callback)` - traverses ALL descendant nodes of a container, calling `callback` function for each of them. Returns `false` if traversing has stopped by means of `callback` returning `false`, and `true` otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn both cases `callback` takes these parameters:\r\n\r\n- `node` - the current node (one of the container's descendats, that the callback has been called against).\r\n- `i` - 0-based index of the `node` in an array of its parent's children.\r\n- `nodes` - array of child nodes of `node`'s parent.\r\n\r\nIf `callback` returns `false`, the traversing stops.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n"},"postcss-merge-longhand@4.0.11":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano/raw/master/LICENSE-MIT","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Ben Briggs","email":"beneb.info@gmail.com","url":"http://beneb.info","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/postcss-merge-longhand","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/postcss-merge-longhand/LICENSE-MIT","licenseText":"Copyright (c) Ben Briggs <beneb.info@gmail.com> (http://beneb.info)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

See the information further down.\n\nDetails\n-------\n\nTo use the library, just include the js and css files, and then call the Diagram() function.\nIts arguments are the components of the diagram (Diagram is a special form of Sequence).\nAn alternative to Diagram() is ComplexDiagram() which is used to describe a complex type diagram.\nComponents are either leaves or containers.\n\nThe leaves:\n* Terminal(text) or a bare string - represents literal text\n* NonTerminal(text) - represents an instruction or another production\n* Comment(text) - a comment\n* Skip() - an empty line\n\nThe containers:\n* Sequence(children) - like simple concatenation in a regex\n* Choice(index, children) - like | in a regex.  The index argument specifies which child is the \"normal\" choice and should go in the middle\n* Optional(child, skip) - like ? in a regex.  A shorthand for `Choice(1, [Skip(), child])`.  If the optional `skip` parameter has the value `\"skip\"`, it instead puts the Skip() in the straight-line path, for when the \"normal\" behavior is to omit the item.\n* OneOrMore(child, repeat) - like + in a regex.  The 'repeat' argument is optional, and specifies something that must go between the repetitions.\n* ZeroOrMore(child, repeat, skip) - like * in a regex.  A shorthand for `Optional(OneOrMore(child, repeat))`.  The optional `skip` parameter is identical to Optional().\n\nFor convenience, each component can be called with or without `new`.\nIf called without `new`,\nthe container components become n-ary;\nthat is, you can say either `new Sequence([A, B])` or just `Sequence(A,B)`.\n\nAfter constructing a Diagram, call `.format(...padding)` on it, specifying 0-4 padding values (just like CSS) for some additional \"breathing space\" around the diagram (the paddings default to 20px).\n\nThe result can either be `.toString()`'d for the markup, or `.toSVG()`'d for an `<svg>` element, which can then be immediately inserted to the document.  As a convenience, Diagram also has an `.addTo(element)` method, which immediately converts it to SVG and appends it to the referenced element with default paddings. `element` defaults to `document.body`.\n\nOptions\n-------\n\nThere are a few options you can tweak, at the bottom of the file.  Just tweak either until the diagram looks like what you want.\nYou can also change the CSS file - feel free to tweak to your heart's content.\nNote, though, that if you change the text sizes in the CSS,\nyou'll have to go adjust the metrics for the leaf nodes as well.\n\n* VERTICAL_SEPARATION - sets the minimum amount of vertical separation between two items.  Note that the stroke width isn't counted when computing the separation; this shouldn't be relevant unless you have a very small separation or very large stroke width.\n* ARC_RADIUS - the radius of the arcs used in the branching containers like Choice.  This has a relatively large effect on the size of non-trivial diagrams.  Both tight and loose values look good, depending on what you're going for.\n* DIAGRAM_CLASS - the class set on the root `<svg>` element of each diagram, for use in the CSS stylesheet.\n* STROKE_ODD_PIXEL_LENGTH - the default stylesheet uses odd pixel lengths for 'stroke'. Due to rasterization artifacts, they look best when the item has been translated half a pixel in both directions. If you change the styling to use a stroke with even pixel lengths, you'll want to set this variable to `false`.\n* INTERNAL_ALIGNMENT - when some branches of a container are narrower than others, this determines how they're aligned in the extra space.  Defaults to \"center\", but can be set to \"left\" or \"right\".\n\nCaveats\n-------\n\nAt this early stage, the generator is feature-complete and works as intended, but still has several TODOs:\n\n* The font-sizes are hard-coded right now, and the font handling in general is very dumb - I'm just guessing at some metrics that are probably \"good enough\" rather than measuring things properly.\n\nPython Port\n-----------\n\nIn addition to the canonical JS version, the library now exists as a Python library as well.\n\nUsing it is basically identical.  The config variables are globals in the file, and so may be adjusted either manually or via tweaking from inside your program.\n\nThe main difference from the JS port is how you extract the string from the Diagram.  You'll find a `writeSvg(writerFunc)` method on `Diagram`, which takes a callback of one argument and passes it the string form of the diagram.  For example, it can be used like `Diagram(...).writeSvg(sys.stdout.write)` to write to stdout.  **Note**: the callback will be called multiple times as it builds up the string, not just once with the whole thing.  If you need it all at once, consider something like a `StringIO` as an easy way to collect it into a single string.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis document and all associated files in the github project are licensed under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) ![](http://i.creativecommons.org/p/zero/1.0/80x15.png).\nThis means you can reuse, remix, or otherwise appropriate this project for your own use **without restriction**.\n(The actual legal meaning can be found at the above link.)\nDon't ask me for permission to use any part of this project, **just use it**.\nI would appreciate attribution, but that is not required by the license.\n"},"randexp@0.4.6":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/fent/randexp.js","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/fent/randexp.js/raw/master/LICENSE","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Roly Fentanes","url":"https://github.com/fent","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/randexp","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/randexp/LICENSE","licenseText":"Copyright (C) 2011 by Roly Fentanes\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Sometimes, mainly when introducing new syntactic\nentities with a certain level of precedence, interfacing with the parser\nis necessary.\n\nIf the `remark-parse` plugin is used, it adds a [`Parser`][parser] constructor\nto the `processor`.  Other plugins can add tokenizers to the parser’s prototype\nto change how markdown is parsed.\n\nThe below plugin adds a [tokenizer][] for at-mentions.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = mentions\n\nfunction mentions() {\n  var Parser = this.Parser\n  var tokenizers = Parser.prototype.inlineTokenizers\n  var methods = Parser.prototype.inlineMethods\n\n  // Add an inline tokenizer (defined in the following example).\n  tokenizers.mention = tokenizeMention\n\n  // Run it just before `text`.\n  methods.splice(methods.indexOf('text'), 0, 'mention')\n}\n```\n\n### `Parser#blockTokenizers`\n\nAn object mapping tokenizer names to [tokenizer][]s.  These\ntokenizers (for example: `fencedCode`, `table`, and `paragraph`) eat\nfrom the start of a value to a line ending.\n\nSee `#blockMethods` below for a list of methods that are included by\ndefault.\n\n### `Parser#blockMethods`\n\nArray of `blockTokenizers` names (`string`) specifying the order in\nwhich they run.\n\n<!--methods-block start-->\n\n*   `newline`\n*   `indentedCode`\n*   `fencedCode`\n*   `blockquote`\n*   `atxHeading`\n*   `thematicBreak`\n*   `list`\n*   `setextHeading`\n*   `html`\n*   `footnote`\n*   `definition`\n*   `table`\n*   `paragraph`\n\n<!--methods-block end-->\n\n### `Parser#inlineTokenizers`\n\nAn object mapping tokenizer names to [tokenizer][]s.  These tokenizers\n(for example: `url`, `reference`, and `emphasis`) eat from the start\nof a value.  To increase performance, they depend on [locator][]s.\n\nSee `#inlineMethods` below for a list of methods that are included by\ndefault.\n\n### `Parser#inlineMethods`\n\nArray of `inlineTokenizers` names (`string`) specifying the order in\nwhich they run.\n\n<!--methods-inline start-->\n\n*   `escape`\n*   `autoLink`\n*   `url`\n*   `html`\n*   `link`\n*   `reference`\n*   `strong`\n*   `emphasis`\n*   `deletion`\n*   `code`\n*   `break`\n*   `text`\n\n<!--methods-inline end-->\n\n### `function tokenizer(eat, value, silent)`\n\n```js\ntokenizeMention.notInLink = true\ntokenizeMention.locator = locateMention\n\nfunction tokenizeMention(eat, value, silent) {\n  var match = /^@(\\w+)/.exec(value)\n\n  if (match) {\n    if (silent) {\n      return true\n    }\n\n    return eat(match[0])({\n      type: 'link',\n      url: 'https://social-network/' + match[1],\n      children: [{type: 'text', value: match[0]}]\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe parser knows two types of tokenizers: block level and inline level.\nBlock level tokenizers are the same as inline level tokenizers, with\nthe exception that the latter must have a [locator][].\n\nTokenizers _test_ whether a document starts with a certain syntactic\nentity.  In _silent_ mode, they return whether that test passes.\nIn _normal_ mode, they consume that token, a process which is called\n“eating”.  Locators enable tokenizers to function faster by providing\ninformation on where the next entity may occur.\n\n###### Signatures\n\n*   `Node? = tokenizer(eat, value)`\n*   `boolean? = tokenizer(eat, value, silent)`\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `eat` ([`Function`][eat]) — Eat, when applicable, an entity\n*   `value` (`string`) — Value which may start an entity\n*   `silent` (`boolean`, optional) — Whether to detect or consume\n\n###### Properties\n\n*   `locator` ([`Function`][locator])\n    — Required for inline tokenizers\n*   `onlyAtStart` (`boolean`)\n    — Whether nodes can only be found at the beginning of the document\n*   `notInBlock` (`boolean`)\n    — Whether nodes cannot be in blockquotes, lists, or footnote\n    definitions\n*   `notInList` (`boolean`)\n    — Whether nodes cannot be in lists\n*   `notInLink` (`boolean`)\n    — Whether nodes cannot be in links\n\n###### Returns\n\n*   In _silent_ mode, whether a node can be found at the start of `value`\n*   In _normal_ mode, a node if it can be found at the start of `value`\n\n### `tokenizer.locator(value, fromIndex)`\n\n```js\nfunction locateMention(value, fromIndex) {\n  return value.indexOf('@', fromIndex)\n}\n```\n\nLocators are required for inline tokenization to keep the process\nperformant.  Locators enable inline tokenizers to function faster by\nproviding information on the where the next entity occurs.  Locators\nmay be wrong, it’s OK if there actually isn’t a node to be found at\nthe index they return, but they must skip any nodes.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `value` (`string`) — Value which may contain an entity\n*   `fromIndex` (`number`) — Position to start searching at\n\n###### Returns\n\nIndex at which an entity may start, and `-1` otherwise.\n\n### `eat(subvalue)`\n\n```js\nvar add = eat('foo')\n```\n\nEat `subvalue`, which is a string at the start of the\n[tokenize][tokenizer]d `value` (it’s tracked to ensure the correct\nvalue is eaten).\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `subvalue` (`string`) - Value to eat.\n\n###### Returns\n\n[`add`][add].\n\n### `add(node[, parent])`\n\n```js\nvar add = eat('foo')\n\nadd({type: 'text', value: 'foo'})\n```\n\nAdd [positional information][location] to `node` and add it to `parent`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `node` ([`Node`][node]) - Node to patch position on and insert\n*   `parent` ([`Node`][node], optional) - Place to add `node` to in\n    the syntax tree.  Defaults to the currently processed node\n\n###### Returns\n\nThe given `node`.\n\n### `add.test()`\n\nGet the [positional information][location] which would be patched on\n`node` by `add`.\n\n###### Returns\n\n[`Location`][location].\n\n### `add.reset(node[, parent])`\n\n`add`, but resets the internal location.  Useful for example in\nlists, where the same content is first eaten for a list, and later\nfor list items\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `node` ([`Node`][node]) - Node to patch position on and insert\n*   `parent` ([`Node`][node], optional) - Place to add `node` to in\n    the syntax tree.  Defaults to the currently processed node\n\n###### Returns\n\nThe given `node`.\n\n### Turning off a tokenizer\n\nIn rare situations, you may want to turn off a tokenizer to avoid parsing\nthat syntactic feature.  This can be done by replacing the tokenizer from\nyour Parser’s `blockTokenizers` (or `blockMethods`) or `inlineTokenizers`\n(or `inlineMethods`).\n\nThe following example turns off indented code blocks:\n\n```js\nremarkParse.Parser.prototype.blockTokenizers.indentedCode = indentedCode\n\nfunction indentedCode() {\n  return true\n}\n```\n\nPreferably, just use [this plugin](https://github.com/zestedesavoir/zmarkdown/tree/master/packages/remark-disable-tokenizers).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT][license] © [Titus Wormer][author]\n\n<!-- Definitions -->\n\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/remarkjs/remark/master.svg\n\n[build-status]: https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark\n\n[coverage-badge]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/remarkjs/remark.svg\n\n[coverage-status]: https://codecov.io/github/remarkjs/remark\n\n[dl-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/remark-parse.svg\n\n[dl]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-parse\n\n[size-badge]: https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/remark-parse.svg\n\n[size]: https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=remark-parse\n\n[chat-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/join%20the%20community-on%20spectrum-7b16ff.svg\n\n[chat]: https://spectrum.chat/unified/remark\n\n[license]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/license\n\n[author]: https://wooorm.com\n\n[npm]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install\n\n[unified]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified\n\n[data]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processordatakey-value\n\n[processor]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/packages/remark\n\n[mdast]: https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast\n\n[escapes]: https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#backslash-escapes\n\n[node]: https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#node\n\n[location]: https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist#location\n\n[parser]: https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processorparser\n\n[extend]: #extending-the-parser\n\n[tokenizer]: #function-tokenizereat-value-silent\n\n[locator]: #tokenizerlocatorvalue-fromindex\n\n[eat]: #eatsubvalue\n\n[add]: #addnode-parent\n\n[blocks]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/packages/remark-parse/lib/block-elements.js\n\n[announcement]: https://medium.com/unifiedjs/collectively-evolving-through-crowdsourcing-22c359ea95cc\n"},"remark-stringify@6.0.4":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-stringify","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Titus Wormer","email":"tituswormer@gmail.com","url":"https://wooorm.com","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/remark-stringify","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/remark-stringify/readme.md","licenseText":"# remark-stringify [![Travis][build-badge]][build-status] [![Coverage][coverage-badge]][coverage-status] [![Downloads][dl-badge]][dl] [![Size][size-badge]][size] [![Chat][chat-badge]][chat]\n\n[Compiler][] for [**unified**][unified].\nStringifies [**mdast**][mdast] syntax trees to markdown.\nUsed in the [**remark** processor][processor] but can be used on its own as\nwell.\nCan be [extended][extend] to change how markdown is parsed.\n\n* * *\n\n**Announcing the unified collective!

The goals are:\n\n  - 100% compatibility with browser pathname resolution\n  - Pure JavaScript implementation (no DOM dependency)\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n    $ npm install --save resolve-pathname\n\nThen, use as you would anything else:\n\n```js\n// using ES6 modules\nimport resolvePathname from 'resolve-pathname'\n\n// using CommonJS modules\nvar resolvePathname = require('resolve-pathname')\n```\n\nThe UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/resolve-pathname/umd/resolve-pathname.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nYou can find the library on `window.resolvePathname`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport resolvePathname from 'resolve-pathname'\n\n// Simply pass the pathname you'd like to resolve. Second\n// argument is the path we're coming from, or the current\n// pathname. It defaults to \"/\".\nresolvePathname('about', '/company/jobs') // /company/about\nresolvePathname('../jobs', '/company/team/ceo') // /company/jobs\nresolvePathname('about') // /about\nresolvePathname('/about') // /about\n\n// Index paths (with a trailing slash) are also supported and\n// work the same way as browsers.\nresolvePathname('about', '/company/info/') // /company/info/about\n\n// In browsers, it's easy to resolve a URL pathname relative to\n// the current page. Just use window.location! e.g. if\n// window.location.pathname == '/company/team/ceo' then\nresolvePathname('cto', window.location.pathname) // /company/team/cto\nresolvePathname('../jobs', window.location.pathname) // /company/jobs\n```\n\n## Prior Work\n\n- [url.resolve](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_resolve_from_to) - node's `url.resolve` implementation for full URLs\n- [resolve-url](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-url) - A DOM-dependent implementation of the same algorithm\n"},"resolve-url@0.2.1":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/lydell/resolve-url","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/lydell/resolve-url/raw/master/LICENSE","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Simon Lydell","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/resolve-url","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/resolve-url/LICENSE","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Simon Lydell\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Each priority level must finish entirely before the\nnext priority level is run.  See\n[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is\neven true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue\ncan execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:\n\n```\n[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]\n```\n\n## API\n\n### const queue = new RunQueue(options)\n\nCreate a new queue. Options may contain:\n\n* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.\n* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.\n\n### queue.add (prio, fn, args)\n\nAdd a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`\nwith `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.\n\n### queue.run ()\n\nStart running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either\nall the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a\nrejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected\nwith that error and no further queue running will be done.\n\n## PRIORITIES\n\nPriorities are any integer value >= 0.\n\nLowest is executed first.\n\nPriorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue\nmust complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.\n\nThis means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`\nmust complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs\nwhile `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`\nqueue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs\ncomplete.\n"},"rxjs@6.5.3":{"licenses":"Apache-2.0","repository":"https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs/raw/master/LICENSE.txt","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Ben Lesh","email":"ben@benlesh.com","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/rxjs","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/rxjs/LICENSE.txt","licenseText":"                               Apache License\n                         Version 2.0, January 2004\n                      http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n 1.

It does that by:\n\n* By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive\n* Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues\n* Maintains a consistent API across different platforms\n* Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:\n  * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)\n  * [the watchexec library](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)\n  * polling\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install sane\n```\n\n## How to choose a mode\n\nDon't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane\nmaintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.\n\n* If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode\n* If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode\n* If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman`\n* If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling\n* Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you\n\n## API\n\n### sane(dir, options)\n\nWatches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.\n\n```js\nvar watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']});\nwatcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') });\nwatcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); });\n// close\nwatcher.close();\n```\n\noptions:\n\n* `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them.\n* `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`.\n* `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/).\n* `watchmanPath`: sets a custom path for `watchman` binary.\n* `watchexec`: makes the watcher use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec).\n* `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.\n* `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.\n\nFor the glob pattern documentation, see [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).\nIf you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)).\nIf you choose to use `watchexec` you'll have to [install watchexec yourself](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)).\nFor the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).\n\n### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.Watchexec(dir, options)\n\nThe watchexec watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)` with the addition of:\n\n* interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)\n\n### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher#close\n\nStops watching.\n\n### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher events\n\nEmits the following events:\n\nAll events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory\n* `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory\n* `change` when a file changes\n* `add` when a file or directory has been added\n* `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted\n\n## CLI\n\nThis module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.\n\n```\nUsage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]\n\nOPTIONS:\n    --glob=<filePattern>\n      A single string glob pattern or an array of them.\n\n    --ignored=<filePattern>\n      A glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.\n\n    --poll, -p\n      Use polling mode.\n\n    --watchman, -w\n      Use watchman (if available).\n\n    --watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>\n      Sets a custom path for watchman binary (if using this mode).\n\n    --dot, -d\n      Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.\n\n    --wait=<seconds>\n      Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled\n      after running <command>. Setting this option will\n      throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration.\n    --quiet, -q\n      Disables sane's console output\n\n    --changes-only, -o\n      Runs <command> only when a change occur. Skips running <command> at startup\n```\n\nIt will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.\n\n### CLI example usage\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --glob='**/*.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --glob='**/*.css' --ignored='**/ignore.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --wait=3`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' -p`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Credits\nThe CLI was originally based on the [watch CLI](https://github.com/mikeal/watch).

According to the spec, source maps have the\nfollowing attributes:\n\n* `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.\n\n* `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.\n\n* `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual\n  mappings.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.\n\n* `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.\n\n* `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.\n\n* `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()\n\nCompute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is\ninclusive.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)\n\nReturns the original source, line, and column information for the generated\nsource's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source.\n\n* `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest\n  element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,\n  respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not\n  available.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is\n  not available.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this\n  information is not available.\n\n* `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns the generated line and column information for the original source,\nline, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns all generated line and column information for the original source, line,\nand column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings\ncorresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line\nthat has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the\ngiven line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column\nthat has any offsets.\n\nThe only argument is an object with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.\n\nand an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()\n\nReturn true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in\nthe source map, false otherwise.\n\nIn other words, if this method returns `true`, then `smc.sourceContentFor(s)`\nwill succeed for every source `s` in `smc.sources`.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])\n\nReturns the original source content for the source provided. The only\nargument is the URL of the original source file.\n\nIf the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is\nthrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned\ninstead.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)\n\nIterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a\ngenerated line/column in this source map.\n\n* `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the\n  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,\n  name }`\n\n* `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`\n  every time that `callback` is called.\n\n* `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over\n  the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the\n  original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.\n\n### SourceMapGenerator\n\nAn instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being\nbuilt incrementally.\n\n#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])\n\nYou may pass an object with the following properties:\n\n* `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is\n  associated with.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.\n\n* `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as\n  they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with\n  discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when\n  running tests, if possible.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)\n\nCreates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)\n\nAdd a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated\nsource's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object\nshould have the following properties:\n\n* `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.\n\n* `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.\n\n* `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).\n\n* `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for an original source file.\n\n* `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.\n\n* `sourceContent` the content of the source file.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])\n\nApplies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.\nEach mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the\nsupplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings\nis the minimium of this map and the supplied map.\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.\n\n* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.\n  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.\n  Otherwise an error will be thrown.\n\n* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap\n  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same\n  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source\n  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten\n  relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,\n  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()\n\nRenders the source map being generated to a string.\n\n### SourceNode\n\nSourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating\nsnippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and\ncolumn information associated between those snippets and the original source\ncode. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might\nuse before outputting the generated JS and source map.\n\n#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])\n\n* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if\n  it isn't associated with an original line.\n\n* `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null\n  if it isn't associated with an original column.\n\n* `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.\n\n* `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see\n  below.\n\n* `name`: Optional. The original identifier.\n\n#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])\n\nCreates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.\n\n* `code`: The generated code\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code\n\n* `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`\n  should be relative to.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)\n\nAdd a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)\n\nPrepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for a source file. This will be added to the\n`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.\n\n* `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file\n\n* `sourceContent`: The content of the source file\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking\nfunction is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and\nthe its original associated source's line/column location.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each\nsource file content and is passed the filename and source content.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)\n\nLike `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator\nbetween each of this source node's children.\n\n* `sep`: The separator.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)\n\nCall `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful\nfor trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.\n\n* `pattern`: The pattern to replace.\n\n* `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()\n\nReturn the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and\nconcatenates all the various snippets together to one string.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])\n\nReturns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a\nSourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and\noriginal sources.\n\nThe arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.\n\n## Tests\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)\n\nInstall NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.\n\nTo add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js`\nand export your test functions with names that start with \"test\", for example\n\n```js\nexports[\"test doing the foo bar\"] = function (assert, util) {\n  ...\n};\n```\n\nThe new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.\n\nThe `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.\n\nThe `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have\naccess to the following assertion functions:\n\n* `doesNotThrow`\n\n* `equal`\n\n* `ok`\n\n* `strictEqual`\n\n* `throws`\n\n(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the\ntests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is\nshimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)\n\n[format]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n[feature]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Features/SourceMap\n[Dryice]: https://github.com/mozilla/dryice\n"},"source-map@0.5.7":{"licenses":"BSD-3-Clause","repository":"https://github.com/mozilla/source-map","licenseUrl":"http://github.com/mozilla/source-map/raw/master/LICENSE","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Nick Fitzgerald","email":"nfitzgerald@mozilla.com","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/source-map","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/source-map/LICENSE","licenseText":"\nCopyright (c) 2009-2011, Mozilla Foundation and contributors\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the names of the Mozilla Foundation nor the names of project\n  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\n  software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.

Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Examples\n\nServer:\n```javascript\nvar spdy = require('spdy'),\n    fs = require('fs');\n\nvar options = {\n  // Private key\n  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),\n\n  // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)\n  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),\n\n  // **optional** SPDY-specific options\n  spdy: {\n    protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],\n    plain: false,\n\n    // **optional**\n    // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the\n    // headers of every request.\n    // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that\n    // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR\n    'x-forwarded-for': true,\n\n    connection: {\n      windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size\n\n      // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy\n      autoSpdy31: false\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nvar server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {\n  res.writeHead(200);\n  res.end('hello world!');\n});\n\nserver.listen(3000);\n```\n\nClient:\n```javascript\nvar spdy = require('spdy');\nvar https = require('https');\n\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  port: 443,\n\n  // Optional SPDY options\n  spdy: {\n    plain: false,\n    ssl: true,\n\n    // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR\n    'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'\n  }\n});\n\nhttps.get({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  agent: agent\n}, function(response) {\n  console.log('yikes');\n  // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request\n  // ...\n  // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server\n  // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!\n  agent.close();\n}).end();\n```\n\nPlease note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level\nerrors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe\nto the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:\n\n```javascript\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  port: 443\n}).once('error', function (err) {\n  this.emit(err);\n});\n```\n\n#### Push streams\n\nIt is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_\nthe client requests it.\n\n```javascript\nspdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {\n  var stream = res.push('/main.js', {\n    status: 200, // optional\n    method: 'GET', // optional\n    request: {\n      accept: '*/*'\n    },\n    response: {\n      'content-type': 'application/javascript'\n    }\n  });\n  stream.on('error', function() {\n  });\n  stream.end('alert(\"hello from push stream!\");');\n\n  res.end('<script src=\"/main.js\"></script>');\n}).listen(3000);\n```\n\n[PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response\nobject.  The signature of the `push()` method is:\n\n`.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`\n\nSecond argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response.\n`callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a\n[Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.\n\nClient usage:\n```javascript\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ });\nvar req = http.get({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  agent: agent\n}, function(response) {\n});\nreq.on('push', function(stream) {\n  stream.on('error', function(err) {\n    // Handle error\n  });\n  // Read data from stream\n});\n```\n\nNOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()`\ncallback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in\nuncaught exception and crash your program.\n\n#### Trailing headers\n\nServer usage:\n```javascript\nfunction (req, res) {\n  // Send trailing headers to client\n  res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });\n\n  // On client's trailing headers\n  req.on('trailers', function(headers) {\n    // ...\n  });\n}\n```\n\nClient usage:\n```javascript\nvar req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {\n  // On server's trailing headers\n  res.on('trailers', function(headers) {\n    // ...\n  });\n});\nreq.write('stuff');\nreq.addTrailers({ /* ... */ });\nreq.end();\n```\n\n#### Options\n\nAll options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.\n\nAdditional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:\n\n* `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether\n  to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet.\n* `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used\n  as a `base` class for created server.\n* `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA\n  chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about\n  interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.\n  (defaults to 8192)\n* `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:\n  `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`)\n* `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition,\n* `maxStreams` - set \"[maximum concurrent streams][3]\" protocol option\n\n### API\n\nAPI is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another\nfunction as base class for SPDYServer.\n\n```javascript\nspdy.createServer(\n  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],\n  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument\n  [request listener]\n).listen([port], [host], [callback]);\n```\n\nRequest listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're\nboth instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three\ncustom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy`\nis `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is\n`false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`,\n`3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).\n\n\n#### Contributors\n\n* [Fedor Indutny](https://github.com/indutny)\n* [Chris Strom](https://github.com/eee-c)\n* [François de Metz](https://github.com/francois2metz)\n* [Ilya Grigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik)\n* [Roberto Peon](https://github.com/grmocg)\n* [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t)\n* [Jesse Cravens](https://github.com/jessecravens)\n\n#### LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Sorts `b` before `a` if true.\n// This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.\nconst greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b\nstable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10]\n```\n\n#### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},"tweetnacl@0.14.5":{"licenses":"Unlicense","repository":"https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/raw/master/LICENSE","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"TweetNaCl-js contributors","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/tweetnacl","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/tweetnacl/LICENSE","licenseText":"This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\n\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or\ndistribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled\nbinary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any\nmeans.\n\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors\nof this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the\nsoftware to the public domain.

It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).\n\n## API\n\n### Parsing\n\n\tURI.parse(\"uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//  scheme : \"uri\",\n\t//  userinfo : \"user:pass\",\n\t//  host : \"example.com\",\n\t//  port : 123,\n\t//  path : \"/one/two.three\",\n\t//  query : \"q1=a1&q2=a2\",\n\t//  fragment : \"body\"\n\t//}\n\n### Serializing\n\n\tURI.serialize({scheme : \"http\", host : \"example.com\", fragment : \"footer\"}) === \"http://example.com/#footer\"\n\n### Resolving\n\n\tURI.resolve(\"uri://a/b/c/d?q\", \"../../g\") === \"uri://a/g\"\n\n### Normalizing\n\n\tURI.normalize(\"HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html\") === \"http://abc.com/~smith/home.html\"\n\n### Comparison\n\n\tURI.equal(\"example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D\", \"eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d\") === true\n\n### IP Support\n\n\t//IPv4 normalization\n\tURI.normalize(\"//192.068.001.000\") === \"//192.68.1.0\"\n\n\t//IPv6 normalization\n\tURI.normalize(\"//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]\") === \"//[2001:0:db8::1]\"\n\n\t//IPv6 zone identifier support\n\tURI.parse(\"//[2001:db8::7%25en1]\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//  host : \"2001:db8::7%en1\"\n\t//}\n\n### IRI Support\n\n\t//convert IRI to URI\n\tURI.serialize(URI.parse(\"http://examplé.org/rosé\")) === \"http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9\"\n\t//convert URI to IRI\n\tURI.serialize(URI.parse(\"http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9\"), {iri:true}) === \"http://examplé.org/rosé\"\n\n### Options\n\nAll of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:\n\n*\t`scheme` (string)\n\n\tIndicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.\n\n*\t`reference` (string)\n\n\tIf set to `\"suffix\"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.\n\n*\t`tolerant` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.\n\n*\t`absolutePath` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.\n\n*\t`iri` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).\n\n*\t`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).\n\n*\t`domainHost` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).\n\n## Scheme Extendable\n\nURI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:\n\n*\thttp \\[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\\]\n*\thttps \\[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\\]\n*\tmailto \\[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\\]\n*\turn \\[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\\]\n*\turn:uuid \\[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\\]\n\n### HTTP Support\n\n\tURI.equal(\"HTTP://ABC.COM:80\", \"http://abc.com/\") === true\n\n### Mailto Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t//\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\", \"bravo@example.com\"],\n\t//\tsubject : \"SUBSCRIBE\",\n\t//\tbody : \"Sign me up!\"\n\t//}\n\n\tURI.serialize({\n\t\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\"],\n\t\tsubject : \"REMOVE\",\n\t\tbody : \"Please remove me\",\n\t\theaders : {\n\t\t\tcc : \"charlie@example.com\"\n\t\t}\n\t}) === \"mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me\"\n\n### URN Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:example:foo\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tnss : \"foo\",\n\t//}\n\n#### URN UUID Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tuuid : \"f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\",\n\t//}\n\n## Usage\n\nTo load in a browser, use the following tag:\n\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js\"></script>\n\nTo load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:\n\n\tnpm install uri-js\n\nThen, in your code, load it using:\n\n\tconst URI = require(\"uri-js\");\n\nIf you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:\n\n\timport * as URI from \"uri-js\";\n\nOr you can load just what you need using named exports:\n\n\timport { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from \"uri-js\";\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n### Breaking changes from 3.x\n\nURN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.\n\nThe UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.\n\n### Breaking changes from 2.x\n\nURI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.\n\n### Breaking changes from 1.x\n\nThe `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.\n\n## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))\n\nCopyright 2011 Gary Court.

It's just skipped.\n\n## Terminology: \n- `sidecar`(robin) - not UI component, which may carry effects for a paired UI component.\n- `UI`(batman) - UI component, which interactivity is moved to a `sidecar`.\n\n## Concept\n- a `package` exposes __3 entry points__ using a [nested `package.json` format](https://github.com/theKashey/multiple-entry-points-example):\n  - default aka `combination`, and lets hope tree shaking will save you\n  - `UI`, with only UI part\n  - `sidecar`, with all the logic\n  - > `UI` + `sidecar` === `combination`. The size of `UI+sidecar` might a bit bigger than size of their `combination`.\n  Use [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) to control their size independently. \n  \n\n- package uses a `medium` to talk with own sidecar, breaking explicit dependency.\n \n- if package depends on another _sidecar_ package:\n  - it shall export dependency side car among own sidecar.\n  - package imports own sidecar via `medium`, thus able to export multiple sidecars via one export. \n\n- final consumer uses `sidecar` or `useSidecar` to combine pieces together.  \n\n## Rules\n- `UI` components might use/import any other `UI` components\n- `sidecar` could use/import any other `sidecar`\n\nThat would form two different code branches, you may load separately - UI first, and effect sidecar later.\nThat also leads to a obvious consequence - __one sidecar may export all sidecars__.\n- to decouple `sidecars` from module exports, and be able to pick \"the right\" one at any point\nyou have to use `exportSidecar(medium, component)` to export it, and use the same `medium` to import it back.\n- this limitation is for __libraries only__, as long as in the usercode you might \ndynamically import whatever and whenever you want. \n\n- `useMedium` is always async - action would be executed in a next tick, or on the logic load.\n- `sidecar` is always async - is does not matter have you loaded logic or not - component would be \nrendered at least in the next tick.\n\n> except `medium.read`, which synchronously read the data from a medium, \nand `medium.assingSyncMedium` which changes `useMedium` to be sync. \n\n# API\n\n## createMedium()\n- Type: Util. Creates shared effect medium for algebraic effect.\n- Goal: To decouple modules from each other.\n- Usage: `use` in UI side, and `assign` from side-car. All effects would be executed.\n- Analog: WeakMap, React.__SECRET_DOM_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED\n```js\nconst medium = createMedium(defaultValue);\nconst cancelCb = medium.useMedium(someData);\n\n// like\nuseEffect(() => medium.useMedium(someData), []);\n\nmedium.assignMedium(someDataProcessor)\n\n// createSidecarMedium is a helper for createMedium to create a \"sidecar\" symbol\nconst effectCar = createSidecarMedium();\n```\n\n> ! For consistence `useMedium` is async - sidecar load status should not affect function behavior,\nthus effect would be always executed at least in the \"next tick\". You may alter\nthis behavior by using `medium.assingSyncMedium`.\n\n\n## exportSidecar(medium, component)\n- Type: HOC\n- Goal: store `component` inside `medium` and return external wrapper\n- Solving: decoupling module exports to support exporting multiple sidecars via a single entry point.\n- Usage: use to export a `sidecar`\n- Analog: WeakMap\n```js\nimport {effectCar} from './medium';\nimport {EffectComponent} from './Effect';\n// !!! - to prevent Effect from being imported\n// `effectCar` medium __have__ to be defined in another file\n// const effectCar = createSidecarMedium();\nexport default exportSidecar(effectCar, EffectComponent);\n```\n\n## sidecar(importer)\n- Type: HOC\n- Goal: React.lazy analog for code splitting, but does not require `Suspense`, might provide error failback.\n- Usage: like React.lazy to load a side-car component.\n- Analog: React.Lazy\n```js\nimport {sidecar} from \"use-sidecar\";\nconst Sidecar =  sidecar(() => import('./sidecar'), <span>on fail</span>);\n\n<>\n <Sidecar />\n <UI />\n</> \n```\n### Importing `exportedSidecar`\nWould require additional prop to be set - ```<Sidecar sideCar={effectCar} />```\n\n## useSidecar(importer)\n- Type: hook, loads a `sideCar` using provided `importer` which shall follow React.lazy API\n- Goal: to load a side car without displaying any \"spinners\".\n- Usage: load side car for a component\n- Analog: none\n```js\nimport {useSidecar} from 'use-sidecar';\n\nconst [Car, error] = useSidecar(() => import('./sideCar'));\nreturn (\n  <>\n    {Car ? <Car {...props} /> : null}\n    <UIComponent {...props}>\n  </>\n); \n```\n### Importing `exportedSideCar`\nYou have to specify __effect medium__ to read data from, as long as __export itself is empty__.\n```js\nimport {useSidecar} from 'use-sidecar';\n\n/* medium.js: */ export const effectCar = useMedium({});\n/* sideCar.js: */export default exportSidecar(effectCar, EffectComponent);\n\nconst [Car, error] = useSidecar(() => import('./sideCar'), effectCar); \nreturn (\n  <>\n    {Car ? <Car {...props} /> : null}\n    <UIComponent {...props}>\n  </>\n); \n```\n\n## renderCar(Component)\n- Type: HOC, moves renderProp component to a side channel\n- Goal: Provide render prop support, ie defer component loading keeping tree untouched.\n- Usage: Provide `defaults` and use them until sidecar is loaded letting you code split (non visual) render-prop component\n- Analog: - Analog: code split library like [react-imported-library](https://github.com/theKashey/react-imported-library) or [@loadable/lib](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/loadable-components/docs/library-splitting/).\n```js\nimport {renderCar, sidecar} from \"use-sidecar\";\nconst RenderCar = renderCar(\n  // will move side car to a side channel\n  sidecar(() => import('react-powerplug').then(imports => imports.Value)),\n  // default render props\n  [{value: 0}]  \n);\n\n<RenderCar>\n  {({value}) => <span>{value}</span>}\n</RenderCar>\n```\n\n## setConfig(config)\n```js\nsetConfig({\n  onError, // sets default error handler\n});\n```\n\n# Licence\n\nMIT\n\n"},"use@3.1.1":{"licenses":"MIT","repository":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/use","licenseUrl":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert/use/raw/master/LICENSE","parents":"eoc-app","publisher":"Jon Schlinkert","url":"https://github.com/jonschlinkert","path":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/use","licenseFile":"/Users/aleksanderfret/Documents/projects/eoc/node_modules/use/LICENSE","licenseText":"The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-present, Jon Schlinkert.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It provides exactly three exports:\n\n- `Performance` class\n- `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS(): number`\n- `clockIsAccurate: boolean`\n\nIn all APIs, a \"high-resolution timestamp\" means a number in milliseconds that may have a fractional part, if the system clock is accurate enough (see \"Clock accuracy\" section below). It is identical to the [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] type in the High Resolution Time spec.\n\nPortability is paramount to this module. It uses only APIs exposed from Node.js core like `Date.now()` and `process.hrtime()` and does not use or require any native modules. It also employs the [browser-process-hrtime][] module for graceful degrades for platforms that do not have `process.hrtime()` (such as browsers).\n\n## `Performance` class\n\n```js\nconst { Performance } = require(\"w3c-hr-time\");\nconst performance = new Performance();\n\nconsole.log(performance.timeOrigin);\n// Prints a number close to Date.now() but that may have fractional parts, like\n// 1514888563819.351.\n\nconsole.log(new Date(performance.timeOrigin));\n// Prints a date close to new Date(), like 2018-01-02T10:22:43.819Z.\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log(performance.now());\n  // Prints a number close to 5000, like 5008.023059.\n}, 5000);\n```\n\nPerhaps the most interesting export is the [`Performance`][] class. By constructing the class, you can get an instance quite similar to the `window.performance` object in browsers. Specifically, the following APIs are implemented:\n\n* [`performance.now(): number`][`Performance#now()`] returns the high-resolution duration since the construction of the `Performance` object.\n* [`performance.timeOrigin: number`][`Performance#timeOrigin`] is a high-resolution timestamp of the `Performance` object's construction, expressed in [Unix time][].\n* [`performance.toJSON(): object`][`Performance#toJSON()`] returns an object with `timeOrigin` property set to the corresponding value of this object. This allows serializing the `Performance` object with `JSON.stringify()`. In browsers, the returned object may contain additional properties such as `navigation` and `timing`. However, those properties are specific to browser navigation and are unsuitable for a Node.js implementation. Furthermore, they are specified not in the High Resolution Time spec but in [Navigation Timing][NAVIGATION-TIMING], and are thereby outside the scope of this module.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThis module does not aim for full [Web IDL][WEBIDL] conformance, so things like `performance.toJSON.call({})` will not throw `TypeError`s like it does in browsers. If you need full Web IDL conformance, you may be interested in the [webidl2js][] module.\n\nThe `Performance` class provided also does not have `mark()`, `measure()`, `getEntries()`, and such functions. They are specified in other specs than High Resolution Timing, such as [User Timing][USER-TIMING] (marks and measures) and [Performance Timeline][PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE] (entries management). Those specs extend the definition of the `Performance` class defined in High Resolution Timing, and to implement those specs you can extend the `Performance` class exported by this module.\n\nDue to the limitations of the APIs exposed through Node.js, the construction of a `Performance` object may take up to 1 millisecond to gather information for high-resolution `timeOrigin`.\n\n## Global monotonic clock\n\nThe High Resolution Time spec defines a [global monotonic clock][] that is \"shared by time origin's *[sic]*, is monotonically increasing and not subject to system clock adjustments or system clock skew, and whose reference point is the Unix time.\"\n\nThis module exports a function `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` that is the basis of all timing functions used my this module when a monotonic time is required. It returns a high-resolution timestamp whose zero value is at some arbitrary point in the past. (For the current high-resolution timestamp based on the Unix epoch, use `new Performance().timeOrigin` instead.)\n\n```js\nconst { getGlobalMonotonicClockMS } = require(\"w3c-hr-time\");\n\nconst start = getGlobalMonotonicClockMS();\nconsole.log(start);\n// Prints a millisecond timestamp based on an arbitrary point in the past, like\n// 280249733.012151.\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log(getGlobalMonotonicClockMS() - a);\n  // Prints a number close to 5000, like 5006.156536.\n}, 5000);\n```\n\nUnlike other functions that return only integer timestamps if the system clock does not provide enough resolution, this function may still return timestamps with fractional parts on those systems with less accurate clocks. See \"Clock accuracy\" section below for more information.\n\n## Clock accuracy\n\nThe High Resolution Time spec [states][HR-TIME §4] that\n\n> A [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] *SHOULD* represent a time in milliseconds accurate to 5 microseconds - see [8. Privacy and Security][HR-TIME §8].\n>\n> If the User Agent is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 microseconds due to hardware or software constraints, the User Agent can represent a [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond.\n\nThis module implements this suggestion faithfully. It executes a test at `require()`-time to determine if the system clock (both `Date.now()` and `process.hrtime()`) is accurate enough to 5 microseconds. The result of this test can be accessed through the exported `clockIsAccurate` boolean value.\n\n```js\nconst { Performance, clockIsAccurate } = require(\"w3c-hr-time\");\n\nconst performance = new Performance();\n\nif (!clockIsAccurate) {\n  console.assert(Number.isInteger(performance.timeOrigin));\n  console.assert(Number.isInteger(performance.now()));\n}\n```\n\nIf `clockIsAccurate` is false, `performance.timeOrigin` and `performance.now()` are always rounded to millisecond accuracy. `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` however is exempt from this requirement due to its best-effort nature, and the fact that it is not an API exposed by the High Resolution Time spec.\n\n## Clock drift\n\n[Clock drift][clock drift] can be observed through system or user clock adjustments -- that is, the speed at which `Date.now()` changes may be faster or slower than real time if there is a pending adjustment to the system clock, for example through NTP synchronizing.\n\nIn the spec, the [global monotonic clock][] is defined to be immune to such drifts. Correspondingly, the APIs exposed through this module that are defined using the global monotonic clock such as `performance.now()` and `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` are also guaranteed to reflect real time.\n\nFor example, if `performance.now()` returns 1000, it is guaranteed that the time of this call is exactly one second since the construction of the `Performance` object. But the difference in `Date.now()`'s value from the construction of the `Performance` object to when `performance.now()` returns 1000 may not be exactly 1000. You may also see `performance.now() - Date.now()` diverge over time as a result of clock drifts.\n\nOn the other hand, `performance.timeOrigin` returns the *[Unix time][]* at which the `Performance` object is constructed and relies on the current time exposed through `Date.now()`. That means that it is susceptible to clock drifts that has occurred before the `Performance` object was constructed.\n\n[HR-TIME]: https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/\n[NAVIGATION-TIMING]:
