## Main application tech stack

Client:

- React.js,
- Redux

Server:

- Node,
- Express.js

Database:

- MongoDB

All of the used technologies you can find in package.json files.

## Installation

Please remember first to create .env file in the root directory of the project and add necessary .env keys that you can find in the .env-example file.

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sandstreamdev/eoc.git

# Go inside the directory
cd [project-folder]

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database
monogod

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Seeding database for development

At first run of the app, log in and check your user id in the database under eoc/users directory. Put that user ID, generated by mongo to .env file under USER_ID variable and save the file. Then simply run npm run seed. Seeding is not working? Probably USER_ID in your database is not matching with USER_ID in your .env file. Be aware that if you clean up the whole database with users collection, your USER_ID delivered by mongo will be different compared to the previous session. TIP When playing with data, always clean all the collections omitting users collection, so you don't have to deal with USER_ID configuration over and over again.
