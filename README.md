An app made by Sandstream Development team, to track office inventory, groceries, and even your daily tasks!

## Main application tech stack

App uses WebSockets technology via `Socket.io` library to provide a better user experience.

Client:

- React.js,
- Redux

Server:

- Node,
- Express.js

Database:

- MongoDB

## Installation

Please remember first to create .env file in the root directory of the project and add necessary .env keys that you can find in the .env-example file.

#### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/sandstreamdev/eoc.git
```

#### 2. Go inside the directory

```
cd eoc
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

#### 4. Run database

```
monogod
```

#### 5. Start the development server

```
npm run dev
```

## Build for production

```
npm run build
```

## Seeding database for development

At first run of the app, log in and check your user id in the database under eoc/users directory. Put that user ID, generated by mongo to .env file under USER_ID variable and save the file. Then simply run npm run seed.

#### Seeding is not working?

Probably USER_ID in your database is not matching with USER_ID in your .env file. Be aware that if you clean up the whole database with users collection, your USER_ID delivered by mongo will be different compared to the previous session.

#### Tip:

When playing with data via MongoDB Compass, always clean all the collections omitting users collection, so you don't have to deal with USER_ID configuration over and over again.

## Database migrations

To perform DB migrations we use `migrate-mongo` tool. To config `migrate-mongo` edit `migrate-mongo-config.js` file. To create migration file run `npm run migrate create <version>` in your terminal. Migration file will be created at server/migrations directory. To run all new migrations run `npm run migrate:up` or `npm run migrate up` in your terminal. To rollback, last migration run `npm run migrate:down` or `npm run migrate down` in your terminal. To see migrations status run `npm run migrate status` in your terminal.

## Third-party licenses

To generate json and markdown files containing third-party licenses you need to
install globally: [license-checker](https://github.com/davglass/license-checker#readme) and [npm-license-crawler](https://github.com/mwittig/npm-license-crawler):

#### 1. Install packages globally

```
npm i license-checker npm-license-crawler -g
```

#### 2. Go inside the directory

```
cd eoc
```

#### 3. Run libs script

This script create two files: JSON file and markdown file.

The first one contains data about packages used in the project. It is used by controllers: `getLibraries` and `getLicense` to extract this data and send it to the client to display information about the used package.

The second file contains a list of packages used in the project with links to their repositories and license file. It is available on the project repository page.

```
npm run libs -j path/to/json/file [-m path/to/md/file]
```
